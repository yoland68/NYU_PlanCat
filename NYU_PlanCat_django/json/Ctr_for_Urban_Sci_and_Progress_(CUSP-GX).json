Students obtain an understanding of needs assessment, planning, and technical approaches for instrumenting a city. This includes monitoring patterns of activity, mobility, energy, land use, physical and lifeline infrastructure, urban ecology, vegetation, atmosphere and air quality.

Students will learn about combining and overlaying local urban datasets (like MapPLUTO, Taxi/Cab data, Tree Census,Transportation & other datasets) with regional and national datasets like US Cen-sus, in order to understand spatial relationships and foster critical thinking in addressing urban issues that informs urban and regional policies.\n\nStudents will gain hands-on training on geospatial data management, advance analyses (geo-statistics, proximity analysis, site suitability analysis,cluster analysis..) , visualization techniques, and applications onsolving real world problems, using ESRI's product - ArcGIS (ArcInfo withadvanced extensions) as a primary software, however students will be exposed to other web tools like CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables, and others.\n\n      less description for CUSP-GX 7007 \u00ab",

Student teams define the problem and craft a strategy to identify solutions, inventory available and needed datasets, and explore possibilities for new instrumentation and citizen engagement to support project objectives. This course is a combination of student team project work, lectures, site visits, and guest speakers.",
