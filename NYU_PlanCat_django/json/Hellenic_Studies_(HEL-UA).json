Greek Tragedy is approached both thematically and formally, as text and vehicle for performance. This interface between the ancients and the moderns acquires particular relevance and urgency at moments of political crisis, such as the civil war, the military dictatorship, and the contemporary crisis. This course will approach this dialogue within these specific historico-political contexts and concentrate on the modes of writing and re-writing it has helped to shape. The course will examine the classical play-texts and the ways they have been re-imagined not only on the stage, but also in Modern Greek poetry, fiction, and film.\n\n      less description for HEL-UA  320 \u00ab",
