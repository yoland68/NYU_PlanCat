Some examples of these events are: flawed data processing, legal suits, frauds (internal and external), natural or man-made disasters (e.g., terrorist acts), power outages, system problems, etc. Although these issues were always a part of the business, with the advent of operational risk management for the first time they are being seen on an integrated framework with specialized teams responsible for its modeling, measurement and management.In the particular case of financial institutions, with the sign off of the Basel 2 Accord by the G-10, a new set of standards was established that will regulate the industry. The new Accord established a new capital charge for operational risk as well as detailed new standards that financial firms need to follow. This new environment created a demand for talents with knowledge in the area, and the size of operational risk departments has been increasing significantly. However, as operational risk is such a new concept in the industry, there are major gaps in the development of these risk managers.This course has the objective to provide the student with an excellent overview of the current industry issues and to give in-depth training on the most important techniques used to model, measure and manage operational risk. The course will provide the students with basic general concepts of risk management techniques. It will be shown techniques to identify operational risk in processes as well as modeling techniques and hedging possibilities available in the market. The course will be given in 12 classes of 3 hours each in the evenings.\n\n      less description for OPMG-GB 2365 \u00ab",

In the OM core course, students study the basic aspects of how firms produce their products and services to gain a competitive advantage, and take a tactical or short-term look at operations. This course is a natural follow-up to the core course. Students examine the strategic and long-term policies of the firm, and learn how the operations strategies and policies are developed to be consistent with corporate and overall business strategies. To do this effectively, students examine, through case studies, how firms' operations play an important role in building and shaping their competitive posture. This course helps students to (1) recognize the strategic and policy implications that can be gained from managing operations; (2) develop a framework for allocating resources and managing the operations function in ways that distinguish firms from their competitors; (3) analyze, develop, and formulate operations strategies to exploit competitive opportunities; (4) visualize how operations strategies can and must be linked to overall business strategies, as well as the financial and marketing strategies; and (5) highlight effective examples involving continuous improvement and implementation of operations strategies.\n\n      less description for OPMG-GB 3355 \u00ab",

The objective is to provide students in the areas of operations management, finance and economics with working knowledge of the dynamic programming methodology and state-of-the-art approaches for dealing with the curse of methodology. By the end of the course, students will have been exposed to: -stochastic modeling techniques for problems of sequential decision-making, central concepts and methods in dynamic programming;-learning methods and theory for dealing with situations where system parameters are unknown, including considerations of efficiency and complexity;-state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale dynamic programming based on value function approximation, including discussions about errors and performance guarantees, and design of approximation architectures;-state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale dynamic programming based on policy approximation, including discussions about convergence rates and application of methods in settings with incomplete knowledge of the system state;-recent literature with applications in finance, economics and operations management, such as revenue management, dynamic pricing, dynamic resource allocation, pricing of American options and high-dimensional financial derivatives, portfolio optimization, asset allocation and trading, among others. The applications illustrate application of the algorithms and theory of large-scale dynamic programming for deriving policies, performance evaluations and structural insights about the different problems considered.The course includes a final project that can be on any subject related to theory, algorithms and/or applications of large-scale dynamic programming. Students are encouraged to use their own research as motivation for the project.Pre-requisites: probability and linear algebra. Dynamic programming is strongly recommended but not required.\n\n      less description for OPMG-GB 4326 \u00ab",
