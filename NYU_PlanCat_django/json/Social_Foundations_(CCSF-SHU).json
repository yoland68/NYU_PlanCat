Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism.\n\nStudents are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions.

It has three aims.  The first aim is to introduce you to key concepts and contexts for public policy and policy analysis.  In so doing, it explores such questions as, what are different ideas about the appropriate role of government in a society?  What are some limitations to both market- and governmental solutions to societal problems?  How is the process of globalization changing what governments can and should do?  The two courses explore these questions throughout the entire policy process, from the way problems are framed and selected for the attention of governmental and other actors, to the way policies are practically implemented on the ground.\n\nThe second aim of the series is to get you doing policy analysis across a range of issues and cases.  We present a framework and set of tools for carrying out policy analysis in a manner that is both systematic and creative, and \u2013 it is hoped \u2013 can make a real contribution to public problem solving.\n\nThe third aim is to deepen your understanding of the specifically Chinese context of public policymaking, using readings, guest speakers and your own in-depth research of a selected policy problem as an extended case study.\n\t\nBy the end of the two courses, you should have a good grasp of:\n\u2022\tTheoretical rationales for public policies, including market and governmental failures, and the means by which governments can structure solutions to these.\n\u2022\tA practical framework for structuring policy analysis, from problem definition to the articulation and assessment of policy options.\n\u2022\tPerspectives on the Chinese context in which policymaking and analysis play out, from the politics of agenda setting and decision-making to the evaluation of policy impacts.\n\u2022\tHow, based on all of the above, policy analysts, public managers and stakeholders from a variety of positions might identify and pursue opportunities and options for promoting positive change.\n\nA key feature of the series is the opportunity to work in small teams throughout the year on a Policy Analysis Exercise (PAE) for a real-world client.  You will design and implement a policy analysis of a problem selected jointly with the client.  Your work will culminate, in semester two, in a polished policy brief that can be shared with governmental and other stakeholders in the policy process.  Your work will also be presented at a special open forum convened at NYU Shanghai.\n\nAbout the instructor\n\nScott Fritzen is the Associate Provost of NYU Shanghai.
