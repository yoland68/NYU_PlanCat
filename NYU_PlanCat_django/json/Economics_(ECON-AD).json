In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.\n\n      less description for ECON-AD  218J \u00ab",

Attention is on the rigorous modeling of individual and collective welfare, and the logical difficulties of combining economic efficiency with the requirements of end-state and procedural justice. Applications include the Gini and other inequality indices, the Borda and Condorcet voting rules, the design of tax schedules,fair division of an inheritance, overcoming the tragedy of the commons, and more.\n\n      less description for ECON-AD  324 \u00ab",

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks -- the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.\n\n      less description for ECON-AD  325J \u00ab",
