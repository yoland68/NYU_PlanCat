The transnational, a new corporate form, emerged to meet these challenges. From scaling efficiencies globally and creating organizational flexibility to developing worldwide learning capabilities, the transnational must continually evolve to remain competitive. The pace of change and its attendant complexity place significant demands on the international firms ability to grow and execute. Technology, deregulation and economic threats augment this already challenging business environment for the transnational firm. This course will explore the characteristics of the transnational, its development, its operations and its strategic execution on the global landscape. At the end of this course students will be able to identify, analyze and resolve the issues inherent in managing across borders.\n\n      less description for HRCM1-GC 1200 \u00ab",

This course will focus on how classic strategy paradigms such as differentiation; brand creation; core competency expertise; speed to market; value migration and leadership in the areas of cost reduction, technology and innovation are linked to a sustained competitive advantage.  In addition, the course will examine how changes in the competitive landscape such as globalization, the rapid diffusion of technology, excess capacity, shifting marketplace demographics, increasing cost transparencies, the erosion of pricing power and the commoditization and unbundling of products/services; are creating both problems and unique opportunities.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ethical dilemmas that confront managers due to advances in technology, greater access to information, and more collaborative ventures that break down traditional proprietary boundaries. Given the recent wave of ethical lapses in business, students will be sensitized to the ethical considerations in any given decision-making scenario. Utilizing lectures, assigned readings, small group projects, case studies and simulations, the students will become proficient at business strategy analysis, creation and implementation within an ethical framework.  A final class project will involve the creation of an Individualized Business Strategy Analysis and Action Plan, which applies the techniques learned during the course to any business selected by the student.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will be expected to understand classic and innovative strategy paradigms and how to formulate and implement them under ethical guidelines. Students should also gain knowledge of competitive landscapes and the critical alignment between business strategy and human resources strategy.\n\n      less description for HRCM1-GC 1320 \u00ab",

Knowledge workers who build inclusive and collaborative relationships across organizations enable themselves, their teams, and their organizations to respond quickly and efficiently to new market opportunities, new competitors, acquisitions, shifting market demographics, new technology, and changes in employment regulations. Successful professionals need to understand how their own behaviors and beliefs, intentionally or otherwise, impact others.  Whether an organization is primarily domestic or international, the potential for internal conflict increases with the expansion of differences within.  In this course, presentations, interactive discussions and dialogues, assigned readings, video, case studies, and student projects are used to explore dimensions of diversity, inclusive approaches, cross cultural models and theories, assessment tools for self, individual, and organizational audits, actions and behaviors that model best practices, and the integration of the knowledge and skills facilitated by diversity to proactively improve cross-cultural relationships. Students will be encouraged to actively apply these concepts to their own past, present, and prospective professional circumstances. Upon successfully completing this course students will have mastered the basic fundamentals of, and perspectives on, diversity and inclusion, various aspects of building trustworthy teams, as well as their impact on inclusive activities and other organizational activities. Students will also be able to integrate their understanding of cultural diversity and its relationship to other core workplace challenges.\n\n      less description for HRCM1-GC 2015 \u00ab",

In order to evaluate the performance of the Human Resources function, Human Resources Development programs and Organizational Effectiveness, key questions need to be answered to create measurements that are relevant and meaningful to one?s business partners.  While metrics are not goals themselves, they can be powerful tools to drive accountability, analyze return on investment and demonstrate the effectiveness of HR/HRD/OE services, programs and initiatives.  Many measurements already in place have limited usefulness, are not aligned with current business objectives or obscure the vital information necessary to make critical business decisions.  Through the use of lectures, assigned readings, small group assignments, case studies and business simulations, students will develop overall competency in designing, constructing, analyzing and interpreting the metrics necessary to position Human Resources as a vital and strategic business function.  A final project will require each student to create an Individual HR Dashboard of metrics closely aligned to the strategic business objectives of any selected business.  Upon successful completion of the course, it is expected that students will have developed expertise in the following specific competencies:  aligning HR metrics with strategic corporate objectives to drive business results; creating recruiting metrics to reduce costs and improve candidate pools; quantifying employee productivity and customer satisfaction through metrics; integrating compensation and performance metrics to maximize pay for performance effectiveness; forging a strong link between learning outcomes and business results by incorporating accountability metrics into each learning initiative; developing a metrics-driven learning scorecard to measure the speed and effectiveness of organizational learning; utilizing leadership metrics to build a leadership pipeline that advances succession planning; and finally, creating talent management metrics to leverage the impact of high potentials on critical business imperatives.\n\n      less description for HRCM1-GC 2025 \u00ab",

Topics include (but are not limited to):  prior and future trends in OD; an overview of popular, effective OD tools and techniques; assessing and choosing the right intervention for a particular situation; managing the intervention; overcoming common implementation issues; and evaluation of an intervention?s impact.

In the real world, managers must make decisions without perfect information, under conditions of uncertainty, and under time constraints. Students will be assigned to teams each of which manages an organization that competes against one another in an HRM Simulation. This affords them the unique opportunity to make decisions, see how the decisions work out, and then try again. Thus, players get a 'hands on' experience with manipulation key human resources variables in a dynamic setting. The simulation can be programmed to simulate a profit or nonprofit organization that is in manufacturing or service. Teams are expected to establish objectives, plan their strategy, and then make the required decisions dictated by these plans. Typical decision variables involve wages, replacing employees, hiring, promoting from within, training cost for promotions, fringe benefits, budget for other activities, safety, employee participation programs, grievances, human resources information systems, performance appraisal programs, affirmative action program, production levels, overtime, employee morale, turnover, and absenteeism. It is anticipated that this course will be team-taught so that the student will learn to understand and appreciate the many different facets of the strategic role that HR occupies in an organization. In order to expose the students to diverse, real-life situations, industry experts representing the various HR functions in an organization will present actual problem scenarios for the students to analyze, solve and present their findings. Subsequent discussions will introduce the students to how these situations were actually resolved. Finally, students will be required to submit a detailed, written report on a case study analyzed over the course of the semester.\n\n      less description for HRCM1-GC 4000 \u00ab",
