The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. The course will examine also the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population. The course will also examine the development of the Arab community in Palestine, and its response to the imposition of British rule. The growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to the growth of Jewish society will be discussed, and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood.\n\n      less description for HBRJD-UA  188 \u00ab",
