Students will write extensively and participate in workshops as they experiment with various forms and techniques. They\u2019ll look at published works alongside works students produce to better understand the craft of creative writing.  The goal is for students to leave the class better readers, with a heightened appreciation for the complexity of making creative works, and to have worked with the elements associated with writing and revising creative pieces of their own.",
