A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic).  By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.\n\n      less description for HIST-AD  130J \u00ab",

The ongoing influence of those wars on contemporary politics will occupy the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the administration of George H.W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The 2nd war in the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and the war in Afghanistan were shaped by the outcome of the first Gulf War. But they were also fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies that were used by those who supported and those who opposed the war.  The course will examine these analogies with some care.

During this period, Chile attracted the world\u2019s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies. \nThis course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile's social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile\u2019s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet\u2019s regime.\n\n      less description for HIST-AD  169 \u00ab",
