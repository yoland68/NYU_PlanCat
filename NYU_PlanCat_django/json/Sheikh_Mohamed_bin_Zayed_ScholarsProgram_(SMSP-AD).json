It will focus on a topic on which he has been a major academic voice: the relationship of government and religion, with a particular emphasis on the way the United States, acting principally through its Supreme Court, has addressed this issue.

It will focus on a topic on which he has been a major academic voice: the relationship of government and religion, with a particular emphasis on the way the United States, acting principally through its Supreme Court, has addressed this issue.  President Sexton has taught this course for twenty years to undergraduates at NYU; it is designed to familiarize students with the workings of the American Constitutional system (especially the role of the courts), and to teach the skills of critical analysis, close reading of text, and persuasive writing.  Because the course moves beyond the substance of the material to the broader intellectual skills involved, it appeals to students in a wide range of disciplines.  Students must be prepared to invest a great deal of time preparing for class; a written paper of five to six pages is required for most classes, and the readings for each class are extensive.  Additionally, they must be willing to participate in the classroom debate and be subject to rigorous questioning by the professor.  President Sexton\u2019s teaching team includes two American trained attorneys who will work with scholars in developing the important skills of critical thinking and persuasive writing.\n\n      less description for SMSP-AD  100 \u00ab",
