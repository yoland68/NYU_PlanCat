All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered.

The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works.

It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and how it can also catalyze new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of horror, repulsion, beauty, sexuality, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today\u2019s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Folman, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Kafka, Genet, Beckett, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bacon, Sherman, Stelarc, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to punk rock and cyber culture.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   53 \u00ab",

Students will be presented with a series of challenges, or problems, that ask them to respond to a specific site. We will read texts written by visionary thinkers, such as Lebbeus Woods and Robert Smithson, and explore iconic sites such as Stonehenge and Shibam Hadhramaut in Yemen. We will also delve deeply in to site specific artworks produced by artists in various times and cultures, with a focus on artistic production in the last 100 years.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   54 \u00ab",

Throughout history and across many societies\u2014 from biblical sources to Bamiyan buddhas, Reformation to the Danish cartoon controversy \u2014 reformers, idealists and revolutionaries have sought to silence dissent by erasing artworks that give potent material presence to ideas. Taking a long view of iconoclasm and censorship via case studies ranging from the ancient world to today\u2019s contemporary crises, we will investigate the power of the negated image or what happened when different technologies of picture-making \u2014 sculpture, architecture, painting, print, photograph, cartoon and video \u2014 clashed in the heated public square and pushed the politics of representation to its breaking point.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   55 \u00ab",

How is the idea of the garden distinguished from but related to the notion of a natural landscape? We will look at Zen-gardens and rooftop gardens, monastic and palace gardens, sculpture and pleasure gardens, mythic gardens in various religious traditions. The course is conceived as neither a historical survey nor typological compilation but chooses diverse examples of gardens and representations of gardens from various cultures and historical periods in order to reflect on the ways in which gardens reflect the human condition.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   56 \u00ab",

What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? What would that be like? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless performance of the sense of touch. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal and interpersonal. Indeed, the haptic modality is the fundamental mode of access to the physical properties of the world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch, and runs a continuous thread for a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches that twenty-first-century haptic scholars embrace. A wide variety of interpretations, disciplines and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social and technical aspects of haptic communication will be discussed. Topics covered in this course include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, experiences of visual impairment, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, funneling illusion and apparent motion, and privacy and security.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   57 \u00ab",

This course will examine the perceptual, psychological, and metaphorical ways in which we encounter light in stories, art and culture. We will examine texts from a variety of cultures that use light and darkness as a metaphor for good and evil and study the works of artists like James Turrell, Anthony McCall, Teddy Lo and Erwin Redl who work directly with light. Celebrations, rituals, and ceremonial use of light like the Diwali and the growth and use of pyrotechnics will be considered.  The class will include a practical component in which students develop their own light-based works leveraging the unique and innovative resources of Shanghai as a means of exploring the materiality of light firsthand.\n\n      less description for COREA-AD   58J \u00ab",
