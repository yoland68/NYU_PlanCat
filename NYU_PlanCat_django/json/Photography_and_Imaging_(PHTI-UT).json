It is a class about seeing and translating one?s vision into images.  Topics include understanding light as an expressive element in a photograph.  Form, content and ideas relating to portraiture, documentary, narrative, landscape and the still life will be incorporated into assignments and discussed at length. Through a series of exercises, students will be immersed in the craft of the medium: understanding exposure and metering, the physical and chemical development of film and print materials, and the means of making fine quality enlargements. Weekly assignments are designed to help the students develop a discipline in their working habits. The weekly critiques are designed to provide students with a forum in which to give each other critical and constructive feedback. Students will view slide lectures on contemporary photography as well as photographs from the medium?s rich past. They will visit and respond to relevant gallery and museum exhibits. The aim of this course is to immerse the student in the issues and ideas that have surfaced in the medium?s 200-year history. It is the teacher?s hope to provide the students with an environment wherein they can grow as perceptive image-makers, interesting thinkers and engaged human beings.\nStudents must also register for Friday Recitation.\n\n      less description for PHTI-UT    2 \u00ab",

Many artists turn to 4x5 and 8x10 large-format cameras for the creative control that view cameras afford, as well as for the high resolution and potentially large scale of the resulting prints. This course introduces the special characteristics of large format photography, including perspective control, creative approaches to selective focus and metering strategies facilitated by single negative processing. The exposure and development methods known as the Zone System will also be considered. Because large format work is physically demanding and relatively slow, this is also an opportunity to work more deliberately and, in some respects, more consciously. It may also inform one\u2019s understanding of the methods and approaches of 19th and early 20th Century artists. The high resolution of large format description can often produce a compelling image of relatively static subject matter that might not otherwise succeed if recorded in smaller formats. Surfaces and details evoke a more \u201ccomplete\u201d, or even tactile appreciation of some subjects. Following a series of practical exercises during the first half of the course, students are expected to develop an appropriate project on which to concentrate and apply their evolving skills in the production of an original and integrated body of work. Technical material covered includes different large format camera types and applications, lenses and optics, metering, filters, special B&W developers, large format printing and scanning for digital output. Early historical processes are introduced, current exhibitions of artists and photographers in New York are discussed and field trips are arranged. A variety of cameras, lenses and tripods are available for student use. A lab fee is charged for this course.\n\n      less description for PHTI-UT 1014 \u00ab",

In order to understand this change, we need to view the many historical and contemporary movements related to documentary photography. We will also explore critical issues surrounding the ethics and politics of photographic representation and the different mediums (such as traditional print media versus new media) used to express human rights issues. We will also carefully place photography and visual representation within the wider field of human rights. And finally, we will study the impact photography has had on social change and the many possibilities photographs may have in the future struggle for universal human rights.

By examining a wide range of visual materials, both historic and contemporary, this class will attempt to understand the changing relation between the still photographic image and the moving image. We will concentrate on three major areas: (1) We will examine the rarely seen films made by celebrated still photographers such as Paul Strand, Man Ray, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Robert Frank, William Klein, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, and Susan Meiselas. (2) We will consider a number of classic films and videos which make innovative use of the still photograph, the freeze-frame image, and the static camera. These filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, Andy Warhol, Chris Marker, Hollis Frampton, Bill Viola, and James Benning. (3) We will discuss a selected group of contemporary artists whose work imaginatively embraces both still photographs and moving images. These artists include Isaac Julian, Douglas Gordon, Lorna Simpson, Stan Douglas, Eyal Sivan, Tracey Moffat, and David Claerbout. Throughout the class, we will explore an unusually wide range of visual materials: still photographs, photo books, feature films, avant-garde films, documentaries, and artists' films and videos. Class readings will introduce a range of critical approaches to the relation between the still and moving image, and will also highlight key works and visual innovators.\n\n      less description for PHTI-UT 1130 \u00ab",

In examining these early techniques, students will make connections among scientific inquiry, photo history, modern technology and creative practice. Through demonstrations and workshops, photographic and written assignments, readings, exhibition visits and in-class critiques, students will learn how to make their own pinhole cameras, paper negatives (on black & white or color RC paper), large-format black and white film negatives, wet-collodion negatives & ambroytypes on glass, digital negatives for contact printing and several hand-coated printing processes over the course of the semester. Processes will be put in historical and contemporary contexts by discussions of different photographic movements in the medium and historical events, and through looking at the work of photographers using the processes from the nineteenth century through the present day. Students will mix working formulas from raw chemicals, keep a lab notebook of all their experiments and take meticulous notes in order to understand the characteristics of each of the different processes and develop more precise working methods.

Whether you want to work in print, on the web, or in video, Photoshop offers extraordinary creative freedom to manipulate existing images, create new artwork, and integrate basic graphic design elements. Emphasis in this class will be on using Photoshop for image manipulation as well as on graphic design principles and non-destructive image editing techniques. You will learn to construct images from photographic source material, as well as starting from scratch using Photoshop\u2019s design and media tools.  While grounding in the basics of Photoshop and digital photography is assumed, early sessions will review basic tools to expand and better control these fundamental building blocks of digital imaging. Specifically we will explore creating and using layer masks and image effects, creating paths and shapes, custom fills and patterns. We will review working with layers, adjustment layers and text layers, as well as reviewing the details of resizing, sharpening, and image resolution for various output destinations. The course will be project-based with several short assignments and a final project of the students\u2019 choosing. A lab fee is charged for this course.\n\n      less description for PHTI-UT 1255 \u00ab",
