While neither globalization of work nor involving other firms or customers into a firm\u2019s innovation processes is new per se, there is unprecedented growth of these practices in modern organizations enabled by new technological platforms.  Yet, the practices of opening up the enterprise through offshoring, outsourcing, and crowdsourcing knowledge work come with some costs and risks of failure.  In this course, we will discuss how to evaluate risks and benefits of such practices by doing qualitative analysis of cases, discussing strategic theories, learning decision making tools, and engaging in real-time crowdsourcing projects.  Specific topics covered include: 1) strategic considerations of whether an activity should stay within or outside the firm boundaries; 2) strategic evaluation of geographical locations for a particular type of knowledge work; 3) service or platform provider competencies: how to grow them and how to evaluate them; 4) when and how to partner for product innovation; 5) how to organize a crowd of customers or experts; 6) contracting and governance; 7) enabling innovation in distributed teams.   This course is designed to give students a truly multidisciplinary perspective on these issues drawing on theories and practices from international business, strategy, and innovation management.\n\n      less description for INFO-UB   70 \u00ab",
