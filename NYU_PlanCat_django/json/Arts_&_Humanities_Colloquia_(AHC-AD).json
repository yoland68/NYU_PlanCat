The basic question, what is memory, is unresolved: is memory located in the brain, or is it\na complex of activities characteristic of the mind or psyche? We speak of personal memories, repressed memories, communal memories\u2014the list goes on. This course introduces the rich variety of ideas, activities, and artifacts all said to be about memory. Among them are memory and place, memory and\ntime, how societies remember, the art of memory, remembering the future, memory and creativity, and metaphors of memory.",

These towns also pioneered recognizably modern artistic, cultural, and engineering practices. Florence and Siena were especially vibrant in this transformation of urban life: the one a powerhouse of culture and industry, the other the Wall Street of Europe as it financed entrepreneurs, popes, and Europe\u2019s kings.  Our project for our three weeks together is to figure out what made Florence and Siena tick. We\u2019ll come to know these cities intimately, visiting seats of government and Renaissance orphanages, climbing towers, exploring the home of a fifteenth-century merchant, and prowling a recently-excavated crypt under Siena\u2019s cathedral. We\u2019ll also read and study the utopian (and dystopian) visions of these cities \u2013 Lorenzetti\u2019s frescoes of Good Government and Dante\u2019s Inferno -- along with diaries, letters, and constitutions. And to help you hone your writing skills, we\u2019ll read the travelogues of two of Italy\u2019s greatest story-tellers: Marco Polo and Italo Calvino.\n\n      less description for AHC-AD  137J \u00ab",
