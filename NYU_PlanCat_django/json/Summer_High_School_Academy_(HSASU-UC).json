A common refrain regarding the road to stardom is that it is organic, and that success is achieved through the process of \"paying your dues.\" There is often very little formal academic training besides basic instrumental or vocal lessons to prepare oneself for a career writing songs in the Spotify or the iHeartRadio-style popular music genres. Larry Dvoskin, who has earned gold and platinum hit records writing for a wide range of iconic music stars, will teach you the creative process of taking poems and translating them into lyrics. Transforming unfinished musical or melodic ideas into complete songs also will be covered. Learn how to be heard, to get your foot in the right doors, to build your musical \"brand\" on social media platforms, and the difference between networking and \"connecting\" to meet the right people and to achieve your goals and objectives. This course is for all levels of musicians, singers, and lyricists, as well as for those who are simply interested in learning more about music. Topics include analysis of timeless lyrics, tension and release structure in melody, and the most current and popular chord patterns and arrangements. Come away with at least one finished or reworked new song and a greater understanding of the step-by-step process of transforming a passion for music into a career.\n\n      less description for HSASU-UC   27 \u00ab",

A real-time voting app? A video-sharing social network? A Craigslist-type marketplace? A turn-based storytelling game? You want it to be the next Uber or Seamless, but you don\u2019t know how to code. This course is intended for those with little to no experience in programming, to help translate their ideas into reality. \n\nHow is what you learn in this course different from the tools\u2014Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, and GoDaddy\u2014which allow you to build a website without knowing HTML? What those tools generally don't do is give you control over your application's flow. Let's say you're building a photo-sharing website, and you want your users to upload a photo, and then select some friends to send it to. You also want an e-mail to go to those friends, and you want that e-mail to have a link they can click on to rate the photo. And, let's say you want a page that shows each users' top-rated photos. Using popular website builders, something like this would be impossible. This course will teach you how to gain complete control over exactly what happens on your website, by defining custom categories of data (like \"ratings\" or \"photos\") and by specifying situation-specific logic (\"if the photo's rating is greater than 3, make this headline red...\").\n\nYou will spend time thinking about the functionality, design, and business considerations of your site, rather than the specific coding syntax. Taught by experienced software engineers and entrepreneurs, it will provide you with a real-world experience that will allow you to: transform your idea into a web or mobile app; develop the app without getting bogged down in the programming language syntax; and learn to create one-click integrations with services including social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn), analytics (Mixpanel), payments (Stripe), and interesting sources of data (iTunes Songs, Google Books). \n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to build an interactive, multi-user app for laptop web browsers and mobile web browsers. You also will visit several tech companies that may include Pivotal Labs and Google during the week to ground yourself in the high-tech environment.\n\n      less description for HSASU-UC   39 \u00ab",
