In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy.

This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components. The course begins with a discussion of trust, risk, and deception as developed in the social sciences and examines how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed\nto create trustworthy systems. In the third and final part of the course we examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism.

Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven\nfacts.

While science\nhas resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees\nof confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the\nlanguage of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different\nscientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on\nincomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal\nbeliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can\nstill put limits on our uncertainty.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   42 \u00ab",

This question will be explored across disciplines, from the philosophical discussion of the (im)possibility of translation, through the literary theoretic debate about the connection between speech and writing, to recent discussions in psychology and anthropology about linguistic determinism (language determining thought or culture determining language).  These debates across intellectual traditions center around the key question of the source of linguistic universals:  do commonalities among languages reflect an innate brain \"organ\" or do they reflect commonalities in human culture and in general human cognitive capabilities.  The linguist\u2019s argument for an innate universal grammar invites us to view language history in biblical terms, as the cultural fall from a single original language, fixed by biology, but such biological determinism is also consistent with the idea that the multi-lingual cosmopolitan human has always been our natural state.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   46 \u00ab",

How are words from different languages similar, and how are they different? Do words reflect or shape our thought? Do they expand or constrain our imagination?  This interdisciplinary course explores what words are and how we think of them.  The course brings together insights and ideas from a number of fields: linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, computer science, history, literature, religion and visual arts to help answer these questions. Students will read materials from a variety of books and articles and discuss them in class, and they will engage in solving and creating language puzzles.  Students will learn how to analyze words in terms of their form, function and meaning in context. Term projects can range from collection and analysis of linguistic data to multidisciplinary artistic creations.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   58 \u00ab",

We all spend a lot of time and effort to evaluate and possibly increase our chances of success, or to minimize certain risks. If philosophical discussions about chance and randomness can be traced back to antiquity, probabilistic and statistical concepts appeared more recently in mathematics. The ambition of the theory of chance has been to deal rationally with this elusive notion. Starting with gambling strategies, the theory now applies to the core of almost all scientific and technical fields, including statistical and quantum mechanics, chaotic dynamics, phylogenetics, sociology, economics, risk management, and quality control. We will provide a broad introduction, organized as a journey in the history of ideas. We will investigate key concepts (including independence, expectation, confidence intervals, or tests), consider their applications to specific fields of science, and illustrate them by computer experiments.  Readings include excerpts from Lucretius, Pascal, Hume, Laplace, Peirce, and Hacking.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   59 \u00ab",

In this course, we will read texts from history, literature, philosophy, and scientific sources, and discuss why we conceptualize the world in particular ways, whether any categories are fundamental, and the degree to which concepts and categories are innate or learned. From the conceptual taxonomies proposed as fundamental from thinkers such as Aristotle and Kant, to the findings from psychology and neuroscience that inform us about our predilections for object concepts and social groups, we will reflect on what this knowledge can tell us about the forces that shape self and society.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   60 \u00ab",

We will explore contemporary approaches to the study of rationality, such as the heuristics and biases approach, which highlights the shortcuts in reasoning that make us prey to biases, and the \u201cbounded rationality\u201d view, which argues that rationality is bounded by the information available and optimized for the environment we live in and that classical economics has an unrealistic view of rationality. We will also touch on neuroscience, both in terms of neural explanations of human behavior as well as interventions to alter it. Finally, we will consider whether rationality as a criterion of human conduct is absolute and universal or relative and contingent on cultural, socio-economic and environmental factors.\n\n      less description for COREI-AD   62J \u00ab",
