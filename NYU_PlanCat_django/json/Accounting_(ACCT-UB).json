Course modules include strategic analysis, risk and profitability analysis using ratios, accounting analysis, and prospective analysis.

The course is designed to equip students with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms. Along the way, students will discover that many companies have not provided their managers with useful information. These managers have to rely on information systems designed years ago for very different business processes and with very different technologies. The course takes a look at a number of pitfalls that these systems can induce and at the dangers in using these systems to make business decisions. It also investigates some modern ideas in how an organization\u2019s information system should be designed. To develop such a framework, students will be required to become familiar with the mechanics of a number of management accounting tools, but ultimately the emphasis will be on obtaining a good grasp of the key conceptual issues.\n\n      less description for ACCT-UB    4 \u00ab",

Financial projections are rarely perfect as the future cannot be predicted, however this course endeavors to model several scenarios forecasted on historical and anticipated results to derive various conclusions. There are myriad variables that can be incorporated into projections, but the best financial model is always the one that is stable and robust, yet simple and easy to build, navigate, and audit. The goal of this course is to instruct step-by-step how to build a comprehensive, multi-purpose projection model in Excel and subsequently interpret selective operating, credit and equity valuation data. Based on this information, students learn how to evaluate a company's operating and financial performance; how to develop an appropriate capital structure by structuring debt and equity transactions which not only protect both the creditors and shareholders, but also create an appropriate risk and reward equilibrium; and how to formulate an educated investment opinion.\n\n      less description for ACCT-UB   23 \u00ab",

This invariably leads to problems of understanding and interpretation. This course introduces students to the international dimensions of financial statement analysis.

Emphasis is placed on the limitations of accounting numbers given the largely intangible nature of the economic assets (e.g., subscriber bases, libraries, and brands) in these industries.
