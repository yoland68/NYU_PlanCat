In this course, we will explore the concept of free will and related topics in neuroscience such as intention and self-control. We will cover the evidence from neuroscience that argues that behavior is, under normal conditions, not deterministic, thus providing a material basis for the concept of individual agency.  We will then address the neuroscience evidence for cases where individual agency is reduced through external influence via learning and the reward and punishment systems.

Finally, we will examine the most extreme cases of this, psychiatric disorders that reduce agency: addiction, compulsive disorders, and anxiety disorders.\"(Science, Technology and Society)\n\n      less description for NEUR-SHU   10J \u00ab",

Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms will be interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during maturation. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of connections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disorders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course will be understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder, and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.
