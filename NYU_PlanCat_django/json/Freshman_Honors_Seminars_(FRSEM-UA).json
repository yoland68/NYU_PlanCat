But sport?and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular?does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers? pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees? early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A full-length baseball-related research paper is required.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  206 \u00ab",

Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  207 \u00ab",

The seminar examines general changes in American families over the last two centuries, considers racial/ethnic and class variety in family structure and behavior, looks in more detail at particular aspects of family life, including childhood, aging, marriage, and reproduction, and concludes by rethinking contemporary polemics from a historical perspective.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  231 \u00ab",

Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent, flag burning and other symbolic speech, and restrictions on speech during wartime.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  235 \u00ab",

In the large sense, realism is accuracy in the portrayal of life or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realism reflects the ordinary life of the average person. The realistic novel and theatre focused on the conflicts and characters familiar to readers and spectators by means of artistic conventions relating to the credibility of plot and characters, the role of narration, and the function of the reader/spectator. The 20th century turned its back on realism through a series of powerful modernist and avant-garde movements that reacted against linear narrative and a literal depiction of reality. Following an examination of 19th-century realism in the novel and theatre (Balzac, James, and Ibsen), the seminar stresses 20th-century reactions (Borges, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Sukenick, Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, and Pinter). These reactions include the stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, abstract expressionism, Brechtian epic theatre, theatre of the absurd, first-person singular narrative, and postmodern fiction. Attention is concentrated on form and language, on conventions, and on the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. Film viewings concentrate on nonnarrative cinema (Resnais, Antonioni). The work of realist and nonrealist painters is also discussed.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  244 \u00ab",

Serotonin has been implicated in a vast array of functions, ranging from aggression, sexual behavior, sleeping, and learning to regulation of hormone release, eating, and neurotrophic factor secretion. Many mind-altering drugs (LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, cocaine, alcohol, etc.) act on serotonin neurons. In humans, serotonin dysfunction is associated with such mental disorders as bulimia, depression, autism, Down?s syndrome, and Alzheimer?s disease. The course assumes no prior knowledge of neuroscience. Its interdisciplinary approach crosses traditional fields like biology, chemistry, psychology, anthropology, pharmacology, anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry. Readings and discussions are complemented by laboratory visits, demonstrations, and films.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  258 \u00ab",

As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  278 \u00ab",

The aim of this course is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. The seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. Students examine social-science analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. They consider the sociologist Rodney Stark?s highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. The final reading of the course is the political scientist Robert Putnam?s controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  282 \u00ab",

To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion, Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion, J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty, Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd, and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK, and Fahrenheit 9/11; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  291 \u00ab",

The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  296 \u00ab",

The course begins with a memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher/bohemian/heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Students will study a variety of readings from the period of the Holocaust. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor assigns introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  312 \u00ab",

Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin\u2019s oeuvre to construct the score, something they had done before (successfully, in The Song of Norway, to the music of Grieg) and would do again (unsuccessfully, in Anya, music by Rachmaninoff). These are among the many instances in which musicians and composers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have reached back into the past for inspiration, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and popular music. We examine representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage (Rent, Aida), ballet, film (Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Alicia Keys, Eric Carmen, All By Myself, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again, Procol Harum). After a brief introduction to the concept of musical transference and the concept of parody in music (Bach, Mozart), students compare original \u201cclassical\u201d compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music and film, and examine the culture of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to its later incarnation. Classical composers/conductors and artists who were critical to this movement are also considered.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  319 \u00ab",

Others exercised religious authority in priestly offices or as the ceremonial wife of a god. This course examines the lives and roles of these women, as reflected in the art, archaeology, and texts of their own times, and often in their own words. Questions examined include the assumptions about gender and sex underlying Egyptian culture, the practical and symbolic roles of queens, the character of women?s monuments, the destruction of some monuments of powerful women by later generations, and changes in the roles of elite women over almost three millennia of Egyptian history. Through their culturally anomalous position, we come to understand some important principles of gender and power in Egypt and perhaps elsewhere as well. In addition, we examine the views of these women taken by Western scholars and popular media and how such understandings of their roles reflect the evolution of our own cultural attitudes.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  323 \u00ab",

No one can deny the value of Louis\u2019 support of a vast number of talented, highly accomplished artists, architects, gardeners (not to mention craftsmen, writers, musicians, scholars, and scientists). Interest in these achievements continues today, as millions continue to visit his chateau of Versailles. In this course we focus on two areas that Louis himself called to our attention with two series of tapestries, The History of the King and the Houses of the King, which he commissioned from his Gobelins Manufactory in Paris. The class begins with the study of the events of the king\u2019s reign as depicted there, along with some other images that were produced at the time in a number of artistic media. This introduces us to major events of the history of the reign as background to our studies, and, further, we discuss these art works themselves as examples of the king\u2019s politics, his taste and the refined and elegant French pictorial art of his period.  The second part of the course, focusing on images from both sets of tapestries, considers some of Louis\u2019 grandiose buildings, especially the chateau of Versailles, its d\u00e9cor and gardens. Selected readings include portions from the memoirs of contemporaries such as the Duke de Saint-Simon and Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, along with historical and art historical publications.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  344 \u00ab",

The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life?

An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  367 \u00ab",

Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life.  They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do.  They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families.  They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  369 \u00ab",

Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  377 \u00ab",

What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.

During the term, students will try their hands at combining history and storytelling, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Whether you loved high school history, or slept straight through it, this course could be for you.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  386 \u00ab",

This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. Combining historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to identity politics and visual culture, it addresses how images are constructed. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. We use a series of case studies to explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display, and reception, particularly in relation to the wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a photograph of their own choice.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  392 \u00ab",

In tracking the feminist, political, and uneven development of sexual harassment over the past thirty years, this course will familiarize students with this body of law while at the same time engaging broader philosophical discussion and debate. Its relative youth, narrow focus, and interesting fact patterns make sexual harassment law an exciting mechanism for exploring the way jurisprudence develops in the United States, and its doctrinal focus on sex and state make it an equally exciting mechanism to explore issues of gender and power. Among topics to be covered are judicial expansion into sexual orientation, retaliation; Title IX and the development of sexual harassment law in education, the litigation process of these cases, and the political and constitutional implications of sexual harassment policies censoring speech.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  396 \u00ab",

With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual.

The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus. Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess  proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud.

In this introductory seminar we will read selections from Pound\u2019s poetry and prose, while also exploring his affiliations with the arts of painting, sculpture, music, and cinema.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  410 \u00ab",

We will consider such topics as the significance of the city of St. Petersburg, once called \u201cthe most abstract and intentional city in the world\u201d; utopian dreams and dystopian nightmares; the city; and revolution. Primary texts will be accompanied by secondary readings that aim to introduce students to the cultural contexts in which the works were written, and to various methodologies that can shed light onto different facets of each text. No familiarity with the literature or history of Russia is required.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  416 \u00ab",

This course also offers a panorama of rural and urban folk culture in select areas of Western Europe and North America. Students encounter lumberjacks, gypsies, chain-gang prisoners, sailors, shepherds, housewives, and scholars, all of whom either composed, collected, or passed on narrative songs. Students read, listen to and analyze many ballads\u2014and learn to sing a few as well. Guest singers will visit the class. Students also conduct research into the history and scholarly controversies surrounding this major art form.

This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  434 \u00ab",

Students will read a wide selection of his works, as well as several biographies and scholarly treatments, and will explore important questions in the light of Douglass\u2019s thinking, for example: How does the religion of slaves relate to the religion of slave-holders? Is there a legitimate use of violence in the pursuit of noble ends? Does there exist, as Douglass believed, a force of progress in history? How do self-awareness, moral insight, and public eloquence undergird the effectiveness of a reformer?\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  435 \u00ab",

If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education, McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  437 \u00ab",

In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world.  The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another. \n\nIn Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits. \n\nBy comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  444 \u00ab",

The key parts of politics examined in this course are how and why people get into politics, campaign and advertising strategies, representation, governing from the legislative and executive branch, managing credit and blame for policy, state budgeting, and specific case studies on areas of current policy change. The focus will be largely on current issues\u2014specifically gay marriage and the obesity tax\u2014framed by classic studies of politics. Readings will come from books, scholarly articles, and news media accounts. Students will learn from a combination of social science analyses of the weekly phenomena of interest and lectures will add the real-life insight provided by a long time practitioner of politics. Because of the advanced nature of the course, students are expected to write a research paper on a topic of their choosing that can be related to the readings and/or lectures of the class. Smaller, component papers will also be assigned throughout the class. An important part of the research paper will be a presentation of the finished project.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  450 \u00ab",

Among the issues at the interface between neuroscience and society that we examine is use of drugs and other procedures for cognitive enhancement or modification, such as improved attention or selective memory erasure. Can society draw boundaries between medical necessities and optional luxuries? If so, who determines this?

How should societies balance individuals\u2019 rights with the group\u2019s interests? In the face of mounting evidence of links between brain structure and anti-social behavior, we discuss the relationship between criminal behaviors.

For these radical intellectuals, America has never been as free and democratic as most intellectuals, liberal and conservative alike, have suggested. (Radicals have been as critical of liberal intellectuals and politicians\u2014if not more so\u2014as conservative ones.)

And radical intellectuals believe these elites have used their power and wealth overseas not in the \u201cnational interest,\u201d but in self-interested ways that have been destructive of life and liberty, both here and abroad. This course will examine the radical intellectual tradition in America during two periods: the 1960s era of mass protest and the current period of war and recession. We will ask, simply, whether this tradition of thought is persuasive and, if so, what might be done to create a more just society. Students will read works by C.

But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  464 \u00ab",

Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine.  Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard.  This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  478 \u00ab",

In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways.  Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex.  For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia?  This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  480 \u00ab",

An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  481 \u00ab",

A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  493 \u00ab",

Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time\u2019s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader.

Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as How is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  507 \u00ab",

It focuses on eighteen key inventions that profoundly affected the course of civilizations and that changed the way people lived and thought about themselves and the world around them. It examines the origins of the inventions, the individuals or groups that developed or conceived them, their initial impact on the societies of their inventors, their diffusion to other cultures and ultimately their impact on a global scale. It considers the transfer of technical knowledge from one country or culture to another and how it is modified and adapted by the recipients and may trigger a different but improved or related invention. In the process, we examine the interaction of technologies and society. Some inventions constitute \u201cbricolage,\u201d taking available resources and cobbling them together to create entirely new uses. Each invention we study generated a veritable revolution in the way humans interacted with each other, organized their lives, and mobilized their human and natural resources. In some cases we consider how specific inventions improved the human condition and/or degraded it. We explore the very idea of \u201cinvention\u201dand weigh situations or intellectual challenges that gave rise to inventive impulses. We pose numerous questions: Why do some societies enthusiastically embrace a given invention or innovation while others reject it as see it as a threat? How do some groups attempt to monopolize an invention and endeavor to prevent its spread to other governments or cultures? The scope of the course is expansive, running from such geniuses as al-Khwarizmi and his algorithms in the ninth century C.E. to Steve Jobs and the computer in the twentieth.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  508 \u00ab",

This seminar examines several of his greatest plays, including King Lear, Hamlet, The Tempest, and The Merchant of Venice. We study these and a few other plays in depth and with special attention to the ideas and arguments in them about life and death, the relations between the sexes, and between the classes. We consider the views his characters articulate about love and hatred, God and morality, virtue and vice. We try to understand what he thought about government and coercion, and about the limits of freedom and the inevitability of oppression and tragedy. We read (and see, on stage and on film) his plays and look to his great sources such as the King James Bible and the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. We learn all that we can about his life in Stratford and London, the world of the stage and court, and the great political and religious controversies of his time in England and Europe. We find that Shakespeare was in many ways not just an artist but a philosopher. His gift for summarizing and personifying ideas make him an elusive but important figure in the history of ideas. He stands on the bridge, as it were, between the Renaissance and the modern world. His ideas\u2013or those to which he gave such powerful voice\u2013propelled England and Europe towards the modern world of science, skepticism and materialism that we now inhabit.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  510 \u00ab",

Although these descendants of Viking invaders never lost their taste for adventure and their warlike spirit, the Normans were also great organizers and the government in Normandy, as well as in the places they conquered, were the most advanced and efficient in all of Europe. They left a rich legacy in every field imaginable: art and architecture, religious institutions, political organization, and educational institutions. The Normans stood at the forefront of a long period of material, cultural and spiritual progress in Europe, and this seminar studies the many gifts the Normans gave to European civilization.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  511 \u00ab",

Students explore King\u2019s thought, oratory, character, and public actions in a way that will make him unforgettable to them. We consider his tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth from a southern Baptist minister to a leading civil rights activist to a visionary leader of global human rights and peace. We ask if he was a radical or a moderate and why he felt history had \u201chunted him down,\u201d as he once claimed to fellow activist Rosa Parks. In what ways can new information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing periods of American history? Using film and little-known radio interviews as part of the class research, as well a challenging immersion in some of the most significant King literature, the course, coming in the fiftieth anniversary year of the March on Washington, makes King and his times newly relevant to our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and violence-haunted world.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  519 \u00ab",

How do socio-cultural contexts and economic systems shape the production of scientific knowledge? Why do certain theories achieve recognition as rational and correct?

This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world.

In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time.

With such movies as Metropolis, Blade Runner, and 2001: A Space Odyssey to document various understandings of this relationship, we also read historical and theoretical literature that explores the passion and violence surrounds these creatures. Students engage not only with the topic of artificial intelligence in film but also with the world of cinema by writing reviews, a short screenplay, and a final research paper.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  554 \u00ab",

We also study the history, structure, and economics of the international film festival circuit, including the strategies that nations and supranational bodies have embraced to compete with the major film industries of the world; cultural policy in the European Union; theories of nationalism and globalization; ideas of cultural imperialism; and, of course, issues of aesthetics, especially as they concern the development of a global style. Along the way, we touch on contemporary politics in a few select countries, with an emphasis on France, Romania, Iran, and China (including the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan). Students are required to attend one mandatory film screening every week in addition to the 2 1/2-hour class.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  571 \u00ab",

This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  572 \u00ab",

Emphasizing historical connections between the camps we use as case studies, which may include German camps in 1880s Namibia and British camps in 1950s Kenya, we begin with the reconcentrado policy of Spanish colonialism in Cuba in 1880s and end with reflections on the implications of Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba for US imperialism.

This had profound consequences: once emperors shared the same faith as their subjects, it was inevitable that they would seek to shape and control it, thus setting the stage for a struggle between religion and politics that has lasted into our own time. We cover the period between Constantine's reign and that of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan and his successors in the thirteenth century, who faced the difficult decision of whether to give up their ancestral cult and adopt an alien monotheist creed so as to become rulers in Constantine's mold. In between these turning points, Muslim rulers (caliphs) and European monarchs tried and eventually failed in their attempt to control religion in their realms. We explore the links between monotheism and empire in varied religious traditions: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Zoroastrian.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  574 \u00ab",

Beginning with texts like Reginald Scott's The Discoverie of Witchcraft (used by Shakespeare as a source for many plays), students explore critical theories about wonder and enchantment as well as read sources that range from books of magic tricks to the memoirs of noted stage conjurors. We also examine stage magic's relation to other art forms, including theatre, photography, cinema, sculpture, and video and performance art.\n\n      less description for FRSEM-UA  575 \u00ab",
