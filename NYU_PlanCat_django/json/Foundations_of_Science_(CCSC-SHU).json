In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems, and the responses of nerve cells are examined. Changes during the maturation of organisms are explored at the molecular level as well. In addition, evolution is introduced as the fundamental means of propagating change that gives rise to new species in the living world. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization. \nPrerequisite: CCSC-110\n\n      less description for CCSC-SHU  111 \u00ab",
