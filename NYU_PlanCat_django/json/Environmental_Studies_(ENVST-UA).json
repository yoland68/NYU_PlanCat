Examining these steps, we will explore themes such as binaries, borders, centers, and alphabetic holarchies. You will apply these and more (such as complexity theory, networks, positive and negative feedbacks) to topics that interest you, from the environment to, say, music, language, biological or cultural evolution, levels in politics, or just the overall nature of reality (your imagination is the only limit). For a flavor of the material, see the instructor\u2019s book \u201cMetapatterns Across Space, Time, and Mind,\u201d or the instructor\u2019s papers about metapatterns available from this website (http://metapatterns.wikidot.com/members:tylervolk), or the instructor\u2019s 3 (so far, maybe you will make the next in this course) youtube videos on metapatterns (search \u201cprofessortylevolk\u201d and \u201cmetapatterns\u201d).\n\n      less description for ENVST-UA  254 \u00ab",

Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics?

We will read recent theories of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors, Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear, Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo). Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space, objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic implications of these theoretical ideas. A main interest of this course is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making as well as by thinking/writing/speaking. Prior artistic training/practice is welcomed but not required; however, all students must be willing to and interested in exploring their \"inner artist.\"\n\n      less description for ENVST-UA  593 \u00ab",
