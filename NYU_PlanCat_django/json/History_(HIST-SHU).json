Not only did it remake the map of much of Eurasia and the Middle East, but it transformed the economic foundations of pre-existing societies, their political systems and cultural traditions. At the same time, the world (as it was then known) became more interconnected, and commercial networks were developed.  Beginning with an examination of the reasons behind the rise of the Mongols, and proceeding to an analysis of their conquest, the course will focus on several thematic issues, such as the Mongol political culture, their military system, their territorial expansion, and their government and administration in all the constitutive parts of their empire (China, Central, Asia, Iran, and Russia). Moreover, special attention will be paid to relations between the Mongols and Europe, and to the development of commercial routes.  Original sources in translation, in particular diplomatic documents, chronicles and reports will be included in the readings. The course will be complemented by visual materials to illustrate how the Mongols have been represented in movies and popular culture.\nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS\nStudents will be asked to prepare a class presentation on a theme of their choice. The Mid-Term and Final exams will consist of a choice of short essays based on the class materials and readings. The final grade will consist of: Class presentation (20%);  Mid-Term exam (30%); Final Exam (50%).\n\n      less description for HIST-SHU  120 \u00ab",

We will study the Qing empire in its relation to the world, the students will gain a sense of how Qing China and global processes have interacted and shaped each other. The course proceeds and develops as a mix of thematically and chronologically organized topics. The topics that we will explore include the Manchu conquest and the formation of the Manchu state, the Manchu way of life and \"sinicization,\" prosperity in the High Qing and its problems, opium wars and treaty ports, disorder and dissent in the late Qing, the fall of the Qing empire and the 1911 revolution, the legacies of the Qing empire. In surveying this history from the formation of the Manchu empire to the creation of the Chinese republic in 1912, this course aims to provide an understanding of the changes, contingencies, and continuities in the making of modern China. The material we cover will range beyond that of scholarly works, to include Chinese and Manchu primary materials in English translation, visual materials, and film screenings--all of which will constitute sources of information as well as topics for analysis.

We will use case studies as a method for discussing these issues.  Case Studies will include: the United States, in particular the American West and New York City; Early Modern Venice and Egypt, and modern day African and China.   Reading loads will be moderate to heavy, but engaging.  You can plan on reading about 100 pages a week divided between the two classes. A portion of your grade will be based on class discussion. Each student will be asked to also write 4 shorter (2-3) papers based on the readings throughout the term. Each student will also write a small research/topics paper (10-12 pages) on the topic of their choice.

In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture.  The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe.  Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia.  Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.\n\n      less description for HIST-SHU  341 \u00ab",
