With varied content, approaches, and organization, this course exposes students to modern literary and expository works, and particularly to academic prose. Texts are selected to reflect circuits of knowledge and the development of disciplinary characteristics in style. Some emphasis is paid to the choice of text in order to facilitate familiarization of critical terminology. Particular attention is given to the role of translation as a means of considering the circulation of academic and intellectual terminology (and concepts) and the development of language by which academic discourse is conducted. The course also introduces students to some of the key reference work and methodology for solving problems of reading and interpretation at an advanced level.\n\n      less description for EAST-GA 1280 \u00ab",

In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention is given to the role of women and marriage in a governing elite, the modalities of social criticism in a novel of manners. The Vietnamese national classic Tale of Kieu is used as an introduction to the course because it combines all of the key topics. Particular attention is given to the ways in which Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian doctrines function in each work.\n\n      less description for EAST-GA 1726 \u00ab",

In part, the course is framed by claims made in new media theory (especially with regard to the advent of digital electronic technologies) and the ways in which new media supposedly are placing us within new world horizons. Modernity, however, is made up of multiple moments of ?new media?; this course provides historical perspective on these moments. Nor does the course assume a technological determinism; in addition to changing relations between ?new? media (including theatre, film, and animation), it examines the changing structuring of experience in terms of narrative form; architecture; art; and urbanism. One of the unifying concerns, however, is history itself and the ways in which differing material conditions create new visions of, and positions within, history. History, therefore, is one of the means through which new media conditions claim to allow the rethinking of, and critique of, the grounds of modern experience. Emphasis is placed on Japan, but comparative material is drawn from elsewhere in Asia and the West; the context is for the most part global.\n\n      less description for EAST-GA 2700 \u00ab",
