Cities create this value by being dynamic environments where\npeople and ideas can come together and mix in unplanned, spontaneous ways.\nDespite the critical role for city leaders in supporting this dynamism,\nthose leaders too often do not understand the role of the market in urban\nareas. Instead, urban planning often remains one of the last vestiges of\nthe of 20th century Soviet-style central planning, imposing untold costs on\ncities and their residents.  Planners too often try to micromanage land use\nwhile neglecting the design and development of infrastructure, which\nmarkets alone cannot provide.\n\nThis class, based on Alain Bertaud's forthcoming book, Order Without\nDesign, will examine the critical role of the market in cities, show how\nthe popular urban planning and policy approach usually ignores the market,\nharming cities, and explore how a proper understanding of the market can be\nincorporated into city planning, management, and policy to improve the\nsuccess of cities. Subject areas will include urban labor markets, urban\nspatial structures, land prices, population densities, mobility and\ntransport, and housing affordability. The course is open to graduate\nstudents and advanced undergraduates from all disciplines.\n\n      less description for URBMA-GU 1001 \u00ab",
