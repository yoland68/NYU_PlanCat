We introduce multiple frameworks of understanding travel behavior, rational or irrational, contrasting the perspectives of classic economic theory with behavioral economics and social psychology, and suggest corresponding policy interventions: a behavior--theory--policy mapping. Then we present a spectrum of instruments for positively influencing behavior and improving welfare: from manipulating information and changing perceptions of time and space, to pricing and framing, to inducing emotions of pride and shame, exploiting peer pressure or enhancing self-control and motivation, and to nudging and preference shaping. Most importantly the course challenges students 1) to critique, design, implement and interpret experiments that nudge travel behavior; and 2) to bring behavioral insights to creative design of transport polices, programs and plans\u2014making them not only efficient and equitable but also simpler, consistent, transparent, acceptable, and adaptive to behavioral changes.\n\n      less description for URPL-GP 2471 \u00ab",

In colloquium weeks, students participate in an in-depth discussion of the paper with the author. Students submit a short paper critiquing the work in progress. In alternate weeks, students meet with faculty to discuss supplemental readings and learn the background necessary to understand each paper.\n\n      less description for URPL-GP 2616 \u00ab",

With one in six people around the world currently lacking access to safe drinking water (1.2 billion people), and more than two out of six lacking adequate sanitation (2.6 billion people), water is already a critical factor affecting the social and economic well-being of a sizable proportion of the world's population.  However, with the world's population projected to double in over the next fifty years, and with rapidly dwindling water supplies becoming both more scarce and more volatile as a result of global warming, we are likely to face a water crisis so severe it will reshape everything from our governance structures to our modes of economic and agricultural production to our patterns of social interaction.  Water will be the axis around which all public policy revolves.\n\nIn light of the centrality of water as a current and future public policy issue, this course explores innovative and sustainable solutions for water harvesting and distribution to address the challenges presented by anthropogenic climate change.  The field of water harvesting and delivery has generally considered water supplies to be fairly stable, available to be sourced in the same places.  As a result, water infrastructure management has traditionally been concerned with efficient methods of water sourcing, delivery, and purification, and with effective methods of cost-recovery for those services. In this course, we will step out of this conventional framework and look at water provision from a new vantage point:  instead of taking water supplies as a constant, we will look at how water sources are changing as a function of global warming and increased population pressures, and then will ask what implications these shifts are likely to have for water sourcing and water distribution.\n\n      less description for URPL-GP 2666 \u00ab",

From tax and policy to banking regulation, poverty alleviation programs to discrimination laws, the U.S. government has historically played a critical role in promoting wealth among some groups and excluding others from such privilege. \n\nThe course will review new strategies supported by foundations, community practitioners, financial institutions and policymakers for expanding this country's successful wealth-formation vehicles - such as individual development accounts and life-long savings accounts. At the same time, the course will consider how effective public policy must understand the limitations of such innovations, considering factors undermining asset formation such as predatory lending, consumer psychology and financial product availability. The course, which is designed to be participatory and interactive, will conclude with students conceptualizing their own assets policies.\n\nPrerequisites: CORE-GP 1022 or URPL-GP 1603\n\n      less description for URPL-GP 4622 \u00ab",
