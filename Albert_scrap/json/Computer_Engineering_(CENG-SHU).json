In this excursion, we will learn (among other things) how to turn electrons into digital logic, how to make machine instructions execute faster through pipelining and prediction, and how to organize memory in hierarchies in order to make it more efficient. Since the only way to learn computer architecture is by practicing it, we will design a register transfer level (RTL) implementation of a MIPS-like processor in Verilog, and implement a simulator of the very same architecture in C. \n\nPreliminary syllabus of the course.\n\nGeneral introduction to the course \nDataflow and parallelism \nFrom silicon to transistors \nThe digital abstraction \nNumber systems \nProgramming in C: basic types and control flow \nProgramming in C: arrays, strings and functions \nProgramming in C: pointers, structures and unions \nProgramming in C: linked lists and beyond\nProgramming in C: the Unix System interface \nBoolean logic \nKarnaugh maps \nLatches and flip-flops \nFinite state machines \nBinary and Synchronous Decision Diagrams \nProgramming and simulating in Verilog [part I] \nProgramming and simulating in Verilog [part II] \nDigital building blocks \nCompilation from C to MIPS \nSingle-cycle microarchitectures \nMulti-cycle microarchitectures \nPipelining and dependence hazards \nOut-of-order execution\nMemory hierarchies and cache\nVirtual memory \nMemory models and multiprocessor programming\n\n      less description for CENG-SHU  202 \u00ab",
