We will look at the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, with Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time. We will read Rousseau, who greatly influenced political philosophy with his theory of society and government, and was an important influence on the French revolutionaries in 1789. We will then turn to 19th-century debates about equality and the heritage of the Revolution. Proudhon\u2019s anarchist critique of property rights, still influent, was an important inspiration for many of the insurgents of the Paris Commune of 1870. Tocqueville provides a liberal, and more cautious, perspective on the political consequences of equality. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century, Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts at understanding the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom, including ethical and political ones. We will see that these later movements still find important roots in figures such as Descartes and Rousseau.\n\n      less description for PHIL-UA   26 \u00ab",

We will look at the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, with Montaigne's skepticism, Descartes' attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac's empiricist critique of Descartes' theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19thcenturies, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time.We will read Rousseau, who greatly influenced political philosophy with his theory of society and government, and was an important influence on the French revolutionaries in 1789. We will then turn to 19th-century debates about equality and the heritage of the Revolution. Proudhon's anarchist critique of property rights, still influent, was an important inspiration for many of the insurgents of the Paris Commune of 1870. Tocqueville provides a liberal, and more cautious, perspective on the political consequences of equality. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century, Henri Bergson's attempts at understanding the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir's distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom, including ethical and political ones. We will see that these later movements still find important roots in figures such as Descartes and Rousseau.\n\n      less description for PHIL-UA 9026 \u00ab",
