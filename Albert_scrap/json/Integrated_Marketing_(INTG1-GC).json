CRM is used to enable a company to move from a product-based strategy to a customer-based strategy, so that instead of focusing on product differentiation as the basis of competition, it can focus on increasing the value of its best customers. Students will learn how CRM has evolved and can take the form of customer-loyalty programs, relational database management, and total quality management. They will also learn its role within the process that contemporary marketers refer to as managing customer experience, which entails consideration of how to deliver the most positive experiences of the brand and its products/services to target customers, new customers, and existing customers. To provide students with CRM theory as well as practical application to marketing challenges, the course will consist of 4 modules: Criteria for a CRM Program, Planning the CRM Program--including goal setting and selection of methodologies, Implementing the CRM Program, and Metrics for Program Success. Through reading of case studies of business challenges involving the use of CRM, as well as articles on the latest theories and methodologies for relationship management, students will learn why, when, and how to use CRM as a strategy for increasing customer equity in the form of incremental revenue from sales, increased profit, or improved Return on Investment (ROI).\n\n      less description for INTG1-GC 2315 \u00ab",

Each student enrolls in the Capstone course and begins by developing and evaluating concepts for an individual new business that will use direct and interactive marketing to achieve its sales and marketing objectives. Once your topic is approved by the instructor, you write a complete business plan for your company. It consists of all the sections that go into an actual business plan. Beginning with business strategy to show the scope of your concept and category research to show the financial potential, you move on to target-audience analysis and competitive strategy. Next, you develop the marketing section with brand positioning, customer-acquisition strategies and tactics, and a customer-retention plan for Lifetime Value. Following that, you plan the media, selecting from the full range of direct and interactive media, and then you develop sample advertisements in traditional and interactive formats for your brand, as well as a database plan and a plan for operations and customer service. Your work includes financial projections for your company, from breakeven analysis to a full P&L (profit and loss) analysis, a lifetime value analysis, and an operating budget. Each week, you share your work with your classmates and the instructor in a collaborative workshop setting. At the end of the semester, you present your complete business plan to your classmates and the instructor. A prize is awarded for the best capstone project.\n\n      less description for INTG1-GC 4000 \u00ab",
