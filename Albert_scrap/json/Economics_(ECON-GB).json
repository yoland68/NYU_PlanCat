Generally, the Eastern European countries are faring better than Russia and the other successor states to the former Soviet Union. With few exceptions, however, the performances of these countries are problematic and sometimes poor. Why has it proven so difficult for these former communist countries to replace their failed centrally planned economies with market economies? In large measure, the answers can be traced to aspects of the discredited centrally planned mechanism and the economic environment it engendered. Initially, it was anticipated that if the old systems were dismantled and capitalism given a chance to begin, that capitalism would flourish, thus accomplishing the transition. Due to the persistence of the deep distortions created by central planning in the communist environment, however, this has not proven to be enough. While ownership may no longer be in the hands of the state, effective market economies have rarely been forged. Income levels have fallen, income inequality has risen, many transitions take place outside the normal economic channels, and there is substantial capital flight. In many cases, crony capitalism has been the outcome. This course provides a framework for understanding the process of transition by furnishing a basic knowledge of both Soviet economic history and the administrative-command mechanism identified with Soviet central planning. Against this background, the economics of transition are explored. Particular attention is devoted to the following issues: the appropriate speed of transition, privatization, restructuring, corporate governance, banking and financial markets, and growth and macroeconomic stability.\n\n      less description for ECON-GB 2383 \u00ab",
