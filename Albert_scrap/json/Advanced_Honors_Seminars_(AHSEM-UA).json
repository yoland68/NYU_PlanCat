It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed.

It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and ?deviant? subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists?is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect the authority that it feels is being jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  105 \u00ab",

Vergil?s Aeneid is surely one of those texts that, for better or worse, has influenced how we think and act. The book is the epic story of a hero, Aeneas, who escapes from his homeland in Asia, Troy, after it has been sacked by the Greeks.

Vergil?s Aeneid is surely one of those texts that, for better or worse, has influenced how we think and act. The book is the epic story of a hero, Aeneas, who escapes from his homeland in Asia, Troy, after it has been sacked by the Greeks. Aeneas wanders westward in search of a new home, arrives in Italy, and then wages a war with the native population to set in motion a divinely ordained process that culminates, centuries after his death, in the founding of Rome. Apart from being a gripping story, the Aeneid can also be read as a foundation myth for the West. It explores the tension between public and private, and between duty and desire; it raises questions about the benefits?and costs?of empire; and it explores increasingly timely questions about the effects that war has on nations and on individuals. The poem also problematizes knowledge, raising very real questions about how (or even if) we know what we think we know. Involves close analysis of this single book, in English translation and collateral readings from other ancient texts as well as a discussion of recent scholarly literature. Students participate in special study trips to several major museums and develop their own special projects.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  106 \u00ab",

Among the themes to be addressed?in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers?are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European ?economic miracle? and its attendant social impact; the ?sixties?; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper requires students to choose one theme and then, with instructor?s assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  112 \u00ab",

The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  113 \u00ab",

The novel has a complicated publication history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text. Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  126 \u00ab",

We will discuss the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  144 \u00ab",

Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 21st.

Often, the power of an iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display, and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a photograph of their own choice.

Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times.

It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes?s nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its implications or suspect its grounding.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  156 \u00ab",

But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post?World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of the human condition, and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the seminal Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of ?the certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages.? Kafka?s work is exemplary; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cortzar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertsz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni and Godard. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and the capacity for humankind to destroy itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd was a dominant stance, even if often treated with devastating humor.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  160 \u00ab",

We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a better writer.

These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories in the United States documenting the history of radical politics, civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664.

But they were also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels, essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years, including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James Baldwin.

How do diplomats and governments react to these changes? Does traditional diplomacy still matter in today\u2019s world?  What skills are required to be a competent diplomat in the 21st century? This seminar aims to answer these questions by exploring the many dimensions of contemporary diplomacy. We will begin with an historical perspective and then explore the different types of diplomatic activities, such as political, commercial, cultural, and scientific; bilateral and multilateral; soft and hard; secret, discreet, and public. We will also focus on current challenges facing diplomacy. Topics will be addressed through selected readings, discussions with the instructor, guest speakers, and visits to diplomatic missions in New York.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  180 \u00ab",

These are questions raised in The Consolation of Philosophy, a dialogue written by the Roman philosopher Boethius (c.480-524/6), while staying in prison and waiting for King Theodoric\u2019s order for his execution.  Boethius\u2019s Consolation touched the hearts of many readers in the Middle Ages (and beyond) and influenced the work of numerous writers and philosophers from this period.  In the Divine Comedy, for example, Dante places Boethius in the Fifth Heaven.  His Consolation was translated by, among others, King Alfred (848/9\u2013899), Chaucer (c.1340\u20131400), and Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603).  In our course, we will consider many of questions raised by Boethius by reading The Consolation of Philosophy and (mostly) medieval adaptations of and responses to Boethius and Boethian themes, including Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde, the Death of King Arthur; and The Seafarer and other Old English elegies.  We will also consult philosophical works that influenced Boethius: e.g. Plato, Aristotle, and St. Augustine. This course will count as a pre-1800 course towards the English major.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  182 \u00ab",

Stone understood the necessity of a fight that brings rights to all peoples. There were those who felt she and some of the other women present were dupes of the abolitionists. History would unfortunately prove this correct, for when African-American men were given the vote through the 15th Amendment, the abolitionists felt their work was done. It would take another 50 years before women would be granted the right to vote. Recognizing, as Lucy Stone did, that the fight for human rights does not exist in a vacuum, this course will look at the intersection of the three major American movements for African-American rights, women\u2019s rights, and gay rights. Looking back over 160 years of history, we will compare and contrast the three movements. We will also examine how events in the United States and around the world informed and changed the dialogue on civil rights as so many fight even today to keep the conversation alive.

Although an integral part of the British Empire, Ireland was notoriously economically under-developed, culturally distinct, socially turbulent and religiously diverse.  Consequently Ireland was the subject of a vast literary and political debate about how the society should be transformed, how its culture should evolve, its language adapt, and its people change their ways.  At the end of the 18th century, the movement of the United Irishmen attempted to put in practice a vision of Enlightenment philosophy, first through cultural politics, then through revolutionary activity, finally through a failed military rebellion.  To put these events in context, we will attempt to chart the history of ideas about society as they were applied to Ireland through two distinct approaches.  We will read signal works of British and Irish Enlightenment philosophy and applied social analysis, by famous writers including Jonathan Swift, Adam Smith, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, and Maria Edgeworth, as well as works by lesser known writers who sought earnestly to solve what was known as the Irish Problem.  Alongside this reading, we will conduct an experimental Digital analysis of a large corpus of works written about Ireland in the period.  The course will be conducted as a research seminar with a weekly Digital Laboratory component in which students will work to contribute to the corpus of digitized books, as well as to the effort to analyze the corpus through custom-designed analytical tools.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  185 \u00ab",

Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  187 \u00ab",

We acknowledge the foundations of gender-bending in, for instance, the works of Euripides, Shakespeare, and Jonson and explore more recent solo works by Kate Bornstein (M to F), Ron Athey (live body piercing and branding) and Greg Wallace (born with cerebral palsy). Intentionally, \u2018The Future of Normal\u201d explores the complicated relationships that exist among bodies, identities, culture, science, and technology--both on- and offstage--with special attention paid to a glaringly invisible community from U.S. stage representation: the intersexed.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  192 \u00ab",

In addition to literature, we contrast \u201ctraditional\u201d narrative cinema with nonlinear cinema, and Realism in painting with contemporary non-realistic art.

We will also examine the process by which narratives constructed for the page are re-shaped as productions for the stage (comparison of Mark Haddon\u2019s Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night to the current London production) and to the use of multiple sustained monologues in plays like Faith Healer. This is a course specially designed for students with an interest in producing autobiographical work, work in the first person that \u201cposes\u201d as autobiography, or work that draws on the deliberate constraints of a form (letter, case history, mystery) as a way to illuminate autobiographical material.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  206 \u00ab",

This seminar addresses the many aspects of the crusading fervor which inform beliefs and politics to this day, such the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  207 \u00ab",

In many humanities courses, students learn about a subject through reading secondary materials. Their research, however, is rarely significant in terms of discovering new knowledge or generating new perspectives. Working with primary materials in special collections, students in this class have an opportunity to work on materials and ideas that have not previously been considered.

After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  219 \u00ab",

This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries.\n\nThese films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  220 \u00ab",

These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  221 \u00ab",

The commitment to avant-garde practices pushed the envelope of political possibility by establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes through the reading of classic film theory. We will pay special attention to questions of anachronism, generic impurity, complex representations of word and image, and filmic ontology\u2014all of which were addressed by early film scholars and have remained central to the Iberian tradition of experimentalism. In this way, we will establish a narrative of continuity between the first and second film avant-gardes that bespeaks the complex temporality of peripheral cultures. We will also examine the lessons and the legacies of Iberian experimentalism in recent examples of contemporary films, which are often framed in terms of singularity and exceptionality. The class is taught in English, as are the primary texts, but some knowledge of Spanish, Catalan, or Portuguese would be helpful.\n\n      less description for AHSEM-UA  227 \u00ab",

For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed.
