Students will develop skills as ethnographers, visual thinkers, strategists, and storytellers through a hybrid of seminar discussions and collaborative projects.

Over the last three decades, national human rights organizations have proliferated; today, a human rights community of some sort exists in virtually every country of the world. On the global level, simultaneously, the International Human Rights Movement (IHRM) has become a powerful force. The movement strengthens\u2014and is strengthened by\u2014a complex web of institutions, laws, and norms that constitute a functioning global system that builds on itself progressively, animated by strong NGOs.\n\n \n\nIn the 21st Century, the international human rights movement faces new challenges and new opportunities. Building on the standard-setting successes of the past few decades, human rights organizations are finding new ways to implement and enforce rights, moving beyond law and norm development to make rights real for more people and to demonstrate that the global human rights system can work. To do this, they are using new tools to better document, analyze and publicize human rights abuse and to better advocate for changes in policy and behavior. And they are focusing on new spaces for international engagement, from Brasilia to Beijing.\n\n \n\nThe focus of this class is the NGOs that drive the movement on the international level (e.g. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists, Witness, International Center for Transitional Justice, etc.); on the regional level (e.g. Forum-Asia, West African Human Rights Defenders Network, Center for Justice and International Law); and the national/domestic level (e.g. Centro de Estudios Legales y sociales, Kenyan Human Rights Commission; Legal Resources Center, etc.). Indeed, each class will highlight the experience of at least one major human rights NGO. Drawing of two decades of working closely with these organizations, the instructor will bring countless examples from the field into the classroom, including internal debates about strategy development, institutional representation, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement (e.g. regional systems, Human Rights Council), campaigning, fundraising and, perhaps most importantly, the fraught and complex debates about adaptation to changing global circumstances, starting with the pre-Cold War period and including some of the most up-to-date issues and questions going on in this field today.\n\n \n\nStudents will leave with a deep appreciation of what it means to work in or with Human Rights NGOs: challenges, strategies, dilemmas, theories of change, etc. and be uniquely prepared to both analyze this sector and/or work in it as a staff person, consultant, or NGOs leader. \n\n.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 2223 \u00ab",

At the same time, the skills of public advocacy\u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings.\nThe advocacy campaign for our class will support the development and launch of JustLeadershipUSA, a new and unique national nonpartisan leadership and advocacy organization with a clear and deliberately ambitious long-term goal: to reduce the number of people in prison by half by the year 2030.  The organization believes strongly in the principles of united purpose, united voice and the united power of the people and communities impacted by crime and the criminal justice system to drive, amplify and sustain criminal justice policy reform efforts. To help achieve that audacious vision, JustLeadershipUSA plans to 1.Develop and support formerly incarcerated leaders, 2.Reshape public opinion, and 3.Engage in policy advocacy efforts on the federal, state and local levels.  To support the development of the organization, the class will engage in 1. Coalition, Membership and Partner Building Research, 2. Environmental Scans of existing Advocacy Campaigns, 3. Digital Media Strategy Research, and 4. Development Research.\n\nThe course will begin with intensive training \u2013 approximately 14 hours in the first two weeks \u2013 so that you can jump directly into launching an advocacy campaign with JustLeadershipUSA. The class will then meet periodically over the semester to check-in and meet with the JustLeadershipUSA team and key leaders and thinkers in the criminal justice reform world as well as with prosecutors, judges and political leaders.  The course will provide an overview of and training in how to affect public policy through advocacy campaigns, legislative lobbying, issue branding, coalition building and community organizing in the United States. This includes exploring the different forms of policy issue advocacy and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing and running such campaigns; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. This is not simulation, but the real thing.\nThe goal of Advocacy Lab is to gain hands-on experience in taking on a social justice issue and make change happen. \nPrerequisites:  None\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 2407 \u00ab",

While we will review the history of minorities in America, we will focus on their status within the cultural and political framework and examine the ways that how we understand rights as either individually or communally derived informs policy decisions and shapes minority institutions. We will seek to define what \"minority\" status entails by studying how ethnicity, race, gender and religious identity, and cultural expression play out in the political sphere. Attention will then shift to minority community building - how public policies and leaders nurture or undermine minority identity, establish and sustain institutions, and create sustainable minority communities.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 2447 \u00ab",

An important focus of the course is an assessment of the role of policy analysis in the formation and implementation of national and local environmental policy. The course covers the legal basis for environmental action from the beginnings of The Clean Air Act, The Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act to international treaties. The sources of pollution and threats to environmental integrity are scrutinized in detail. Consequences of pollution on the environment and health are considered. Potential policy alternatives for solutions are discussed. Importantly, the health studies including epidemiology, human exposures, animal models, and in vitro cell studies are reviewed. Science-based environmental regulation versus cost-benefit scenarios and advocacy by regulated industry and public health organizations are highlighted. The course covers air pollution, global warming and land use with an emphasis on wilderness protection. \n\n      less description for PADM-GP 2466 \u00ab",

With nonprofits addressing significant community needs with constricting financial resources, board members must provide both strategic leadership and responsible stewardship, with a focus on financial sustainability.  This course will examine the role of the board and will explore common questions about the roles of board members: Are board members essentially advocates and fundraisers?  Do they direct the organization to the extent staff is unable? Or is the board\u2019s role primarily defined by their need to resolve a crisis situation for the nonprofit organization?\n\nBy the end of this course, students will understand how nonprofits are governed and some of the current issues in nonprofit governance. Topics covered in classroom lecture, discussion and applied case studies will include the structure, functions, recruitment and composition of nonprofit boards; the relation of the board to management; the board\u2019s role in both compliance and strategic planning; and improving board performance and accountability.\n\nAt the end of the course, learners will understand:\n1. Board structure, functions and composition.\n2. The relationship of the board to organizational/CEO performance.\n3. Fiduciary, strategic, and generative governance.\n4. Common problems and issues in non-profit governance, from both short and long term perspectives.\n5. How to assess interventions to improve board performance.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 4135 \u00ab",

High-involvement strategies are increasingly used in a variety of processes to involve people at all levels in changing their own system or organization.  High-leverage strategies are used to involve people in systematic ways to sustain those changes.  This two-day course provides a comprehensive overview of the major change methods being used today.  A brief review identifying core principles, assumptions and processes of over 60 such techniques will be made.  In addition, participants will engage in designing and implementing three such interventions as a class:  Appreciative Inquiry, Dialogue, and Future Search.\n \nStudents of Organizational Development and Change who are interested in promoting and implementing dramatic and sustainable change need to explore and understand the core principles, assumptions and processes of such strategies.  Often termed Large-Scale Interventions, these methods are being used more and more as diverse organizations confront changing environments, expectations and realities.  It is no wonder that organizations as large as General Motors and various state government departments (social services, corrections) and as small as the local public school and community group which are interested in ?turning things around? are investigating the use of such interventions.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 4146 \u00ab",

Finally, we will consider the causes and consequences of fiscal distress that may interfere with service provision, and the role of different institutions in avoiding and alleviating local fiscal distress.  In making these inquiries, we will often evaluate cities (which are formally known as \u201cmunicipal corporations\u201d) as economic units not unlike publicly held corporations, with \u201cshareholders\u201d (voters), a \u201cboard of directors\u201d (mayor and city council), and \u201cproduct lines\u201d (street cleaning and maintenance, safety, education, recreation, libraries) that it offers to potential \u201cconsumers\u201d (residents, employers, and employees).

The course will address key theoretical questions of accountability, including the sources from which an NGO\u2019s legitimacy is drawn and determined, and the ways in which different sources of legitimacy may change the nature of accountability for the NGO in question. \n\nThe course will utilize a series of case studies and hypotheticals to encourage class discussion about what NGO accountability should look like in practice, seeking to help students understand that the most difficult questions of accountability often center on the balancing of interests of different stakeholders. \n\nThe course will also briefly review the range of legal and regulatory frameworks and mechanisms currently in place domestically, regionally, and internationally; while acknowledging that true accountability may depend most on voluntary mechanisms that individual NGOs put in place.\n\nPrerequisites: CORE-GP 1022\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 4217 \u00ab",

Consequently the course takes a  primarily qualitative approach to evaluation and how to evaluate the  effectiveness of evaluation.\n\nBy the end of the course successful students should be able to:\n1.      Prepare an evaluation to be carried out by an international development organization including identifying when and why one is needed, preparing a terms of reference including a report outline; identifying skill needs for evaluators and a plan for implementing and following up of the evaluation.\n2.      Describe the different issues or problems in designing and developing an evaluation including deciding when one would be cost effective and when not; also the criteria for developing an evaluation plan for an organization.\n3.      Define which form of evaluation is most appropriate for a given problem whether it be one of policy, strategy, program or project.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 4223 \u00ab",

This graduate level course will examine the incredible successes of LGBT rights activism in the U.S. and globally, and the treatment of LGBT people in several policy areas, with an in-depth focus on several issues that afford a broad overview of domestic and global LGBT policy. These are: health policy and HIV prevention and care; elder issues; youth and education policy; criminal justice issues, including best practices for safely managing LGBT prisoners and juvenile offenders and reducing victimization; family recognition and the policy implications of race and gender differences among same-sex couple households; and LGBT rights struggles in the former Soviet bloc, Africa, and elsewhere.\n\n      less description for PADM-GP 4444 \u00ab",
