We will examine the design of sequences in various kinds of films, talk about strategies of coverage, and trace the basics of post-production workflow.   This class also incorporates a weekly lab, in which the students will learn the basics of Avid in an intensive hands on environment cutting assigned exercises which will be reviewed looking at issues of pacing, emphasis and sequencing. After the four-minute MOS project is filmed, we will apply those principles as we workshop the students\u2019 films.",

The course also examines specific deal points of licenses, and the role of sales agents and the process of negotiating a deal to represent a film.\n\nOnce the student has a working knowledge of festivals and how a film is brought to market, students prepare for the financing of their 2nd year films by preparing business plans and learning Movie Magic Budgeting software. The course also investigates the uses of social media and Internet crowd funding sites to help finance their films.\n\n      less description for GFMTV-GT 2008 \u00ab",

The students will be taught the basics of camera operation, light measurement, exposure, and visual composition as well as the observation and study of natural light and its effect on cinematography.  A variety of film emulsions and filters will be used to capture and control images.  The students will be taught to add, modify, and remove light to further enhance their imagery.  We will use set protocol to maximize our efficient use of time in a naturally lit location.  Also, the students will learn the essential job descriptions and division of labor that an efficient film crew requires.  During the latter part of the semester, the students will study and use the MiniDV camera in preparation for class assignments.  Finally and most importantly, we will study the fundamental mechanical procedures and basic terminology required to be a successful cinematographer and artistic collaborator.  In the spring semester the course is intended to introduce the students to basic color moving image-capturing techniques for film and digital media with a concentration in lighting.  We will use color negative, color reversal, and MiniDV tape as capture mediums.  We will discuss basic electricity and its safe use in support of good lighting.  Ultimately, the students will be prepared for studio and location shooting environments.\n\n      less description for GFMTV-GT 2083 \u00ab",

Learning the nuances of controlling source and shadow in order to create a mood and a feeling will advance the ultimate goal as filmmakers: to tell a good story.  In this class you will get practical experience, with the tools and the hardware used in the industry, and you will work through the esthetic decisions every cinematographer must make. But lighting is just part of the story. The heart of cinematography is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement and lens choice, which together with the lighting style will give your films their unique life.  Specifically we will learn: the Arri SR2, the Sony EX1 HD camera, essential lighting and grip equipment, color film stocks, hard light vs. soft light, location shooting, color temperature and fluorescent lights, exterior lighting and control of natural light, covering a scene and continuity from a cinematographer's point of view, composition, and camera and actor choreography.  In each class, we will look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them, using the elements noted above. We will shoot many exercises with both the film and the HD cameras.\n\n      less description for GFMTV-GT 2126 \u00ab",
