This course uses the Hudson River as a model to investigate the sources, transport, transformation, toxic effects, management strategies, and remediation of polluted ecosystems. Over 200 miles of the Hudson River estuary has been designated a U.S. federal Superfund site because of contamination from PCBs, dioxins, and metals. As baseline information, this highly interdisciplinary course initially investigates the geological history of the Hudson River, its hydrology, and inventory of species composition. Those chemical, physical, and biological factors impacting the bioavailability of contaminants to the ecosystem are presented. Efforts to model the trophic transfer of PCBs through the food chain are discussed. Toxic effects (cancer, reproductive disorders, immunological changes, etc.) of these contaminants to Hudson River fish, bird, and mammalian populations are highlighted. Models of resistance of populations to chemical contaminants are explored. Accumulation of toxicants and possible effects on human consumers of Hudson River resources are introduced. Potential beneficial effects of microbial bioremediation strategies are introduced. Problems and issues in the management of Hudson River Superfund sites are discussed by regulatory officials as are the strategies of advocacy groups to remediate these sites. Impacts of remediation of one site on its natural populations are presented.\n\n      less description for EHSC-GA 1005 \u00ab",

This course begins with a comprehensive presentation of various microarray platforms and describes how they are used to measure global gene expression as mRNA. Various methods of measuring protein expression are also presented, as well as methods of data organization and analysis that are necessary for conversion of the massive volume of information generated by microarray technology into useful knowledge. Examples from the published literature are presented throughout that demonstrate both the principles of microarray technology and the practical applications of toxicogenomics. The latter include the classification of tumors in human subjects and prediction of their response to treatment, the identification of biomarkers of disease, the categorization of toxicants, and the elucidation of mechanisms of toxicity.\n\n      less description for EHSC-GA 1008 \u00ab",

Signaling motifs (e.g., nuclear transcription receptors, kinase/phosphatase cascades, G-coupled protein receptors, etc.) are components of signaling webs, which are targets of disruption by environmental pollutants. This course covers various signal transduction pathways such as cytokine signaling and signal transduction to the nucleus by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Some of the known detailed mechanisms, such as regulation of MAPK by phosphatases (removal of phosphorylation) and dual phosphorylation of MAPK on the relevant threonine and tyrosine leading to the downstream activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation, are discussed. The course further illustrates that alteration of the pathways by environmental pollutants, such as transition metals and airborne particles, may be implicated in pathological processes, cancer, inflammation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Students gain a basic understanding of principles emerging in the signaling field and how they serve as guiding tools for students engaged in basic, clinical, and translational medical research.\n\n      less description for EHSC-GA 2043 \u00ab",

Ergonomists apply knowledge from biomechanics, physiology, psychology, and engineering to the design of tasks, work organization, work environment, workstations, and tools. Taking a ?system approach? to the design of work, this course examines the interactions between the human worker and the equipment used at work. The course focuses on the design of the manufacturing process in the context of implementing an ergonomics program for injury prevention. In the first half, it demonstrates how the principles of physiology and biomechanics apply to workstation and tool design. The second half of the course covers industrial ergonomics applications: controlling cumulative trauma disorders of the upper extremities, office work, and manual material handling.\n\n      less description for EHSC-GA 2131 \u00ab",
