This hands-on course will help students make important decisions about their own values and belief systems, and figure out how to put those into practice.  Students will then reflect on the experience in the form of small writing exercises and a final project.  Guest speakers will include activists from local organizations and former Gallatin students who have gone on to pursue activism.  Readings will include a range of \u201cclassic\u201d and more contemporary texts on the connection between critical theories and practice, including: Paulo Freire, Martin Luther King, Cornel West, Frances Moore Lappe, among others.\n\n      less description for CLI-UG 1403 \u00ab",

This course explores how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), a powerful application in mapping technology, as a tool for cultural documentation, community engagement, and public policy analysis.  We will explore the effectiveness of GIS as a mapping tool to help understand historical patterns of demographics, and to empower community members to become informed citizens in the decision-making process.  Specific skills we'll learn include how to geocode addresses, do a spatial analysis, and use census data to map the racial and income composition of New York neighborhoods.  You will also work with local community-based organizations to understand how community nonprofits are using GIS mapping as a tool for research and strategic planning.\n\n      less description for CLI-UG 1422 \u00ab",

Commercialization has created two kinds of Hip-Hop: one is focused on the community and connected to a long legacy and history of Black/Caribbean experience, and a second focused on individualism and celebrating instant gratification, funded by big corporations to sell brands and consumption as a lifestyle. What determining factors caused this evolution and what does it mean? This course tracks Hip-Hop\u2019s history and its influences through participatory action research, media literacy, archiving, and service learning. Students will research, analyze, interpret, chronicle, and sample Hip-Hop by organizing and curating a Hip-Hop project. We will visit Hip-Hop archives, landmarks and organizations, and hear first-hand accounts from Hip-Hop pioneers and leaders. Books include: Yes, Yes Ya\u2019ll by Jim Fricke and Charlie Ahearn, Born To Use Mics  by Michael Eric Dyson and Sohail Daulatzai, The Tanning of America by Steve Stoute, and The Big Payback by Dan Charnas.\n\n      less description for CLI-UG 1436 \u00ab",

This course investigates the causes and experiences of incarceration amongst girls and women, as well as helps students design and facilitate an arts and education program for incarcerated girls. What are the unique concerns presented by incarcerated female populations? What must we understand about the policing of gender and sexuality in order to meet the needs of incarcerated girls and women? What role does trauma play in the experiences of girls remitted to the juvenile justice system? What is the role of the arts in empowering inmate populations? Exploring these and other questions enables students to better understand the role of the Prison Industrial Complex in defining and policing gender roles and sexual minorities. Readings include The Color of Violence: The Incite! Anthology by INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence; Global Lockdown: Race, Gender, and the Prison-Industrial Complex by Julia Sudbury; Queer Injustice by Andrea Ritchie, and Girls Like Us by Rachel Lloyd.\n\n      less description for CLI-UG 1443 \u00ab",

In class they will read about and discuss such key issues as adult literacy education policy and the impact on the field\u2014including instruction, implications of being marginalized by educational systems, instructional approaches developed for adults and the steps that might be taken to build support for high-quality, adult basic-skills programs. Throughout the course, students will relate such issues to their own on-site experiences in class discussion and role-playing, and create a portfolio of writing that includes on-site observations, lesson plans, reflections, and a final analytical paper. Readings may include Making Meaning, Making Change (Auerbach); We Make the Road by Walking (Horton and Freire); Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Freire), as well as other articles and journals (Focus on Basics and The Change Agent).\n\n      less description for CLI-UG 1460 \u00ab",

Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class.  The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community?s life.  The course will focus on policies that are empowering.
