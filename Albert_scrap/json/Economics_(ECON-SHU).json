We will examine the basic workings of the national economies (macroeconomics) and then explain the role of international trade and international finance.  We show how the forces of globalization affect international business, down to the impact on the future careers of NYU students.  The challenges presented by tepid economic growth in Europe, a soft landing in China, and the changing dynamics in the US, and the long run prospects for global economic growth and development are discussed\nThe course is divided into three parts:\t\n\u2022         Part I Understanding the modern macro economy. An understanding of the modern macro economy is essential in order to look at the relationships among countries.  We start by defining the measures that characterize evolving economic well-being, from economic growth to inflation and income distribution. We examine how the economy grows in the long term and the role of productivity. We focus on the business cycle and how fiscal and monetary policies affect the economy in the short run and long run. Finally, we explore the role of banks and central breaks and the importance of financial stability and the consequences of financial crises.\n\u2022\tPart II Trade and trade policy. As international trade plays a central role in fostering globalization, we start with an examination of the economics of international trade in goods and services. We examine the role of comparative advantage as a determinant of the location of production and the direction of trade. We also examine the reasons for and effects of government policies that create impediments to international trade. We show the impact of tariff and subsidies on real life situations, such as the agricultural barriers in Europe and the effect of the MTA on Chinese exports.\n\u2022\tPart III Exchange rates, international finance, crises and development. The final module addresses the role of money and finance in an international context.  We start with the Balance of Payments and macroeconomics of international financial flows.  We then turn to the role of exchange rates in international finance and explore the factors that determine exchange rates such as inflation, growth and interest rates. Government exchange rate policies and the choice between fixed and flexible exchange rates are examined. We discuss the impact of the non-convertibility of the yuan, we ask when a monetary union such as the Euro area makes sense and discuss whether the Euro will survive.   \nIn short, Economics of Global Business provides NYU students with an overview of global economic issues.  It serves as the basis for the International Studies Project and is a guide for many elective courses in international business and economics.\nPre-requisite: ECON-SHU 150\n\n      less description for ECON-SHU  251 \u00ab",
