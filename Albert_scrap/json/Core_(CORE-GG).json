New innovations are influencing creativity, producing major changes in the lives and work of artists. This proseminar develops an interdisciplinary approach to an understanding of the arts and artists in a social context. What are the key factors that link the evolution of he arts to ancient even prehistoric times and to the present? Is there continuity between the \"ritual dramas\" of First Peoples and the efforts to create arts based rituals in the present? How are the arts influenced by social change? How are artists interpreting and challenging the major social forces transforming the  planet? In what ways are artists creating alternative visions of the future that influence our own daily lives? In exploring these issues, the seminar seeks to illuminate the contributions of art to an understanding of our age. Students produce their own evening of arts performances and projects. Readings may include Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet, Sarton's Journal of a Solitude, Berger's Ways of Seeing or Shape of a Pocket, Chaiken's The Presence of the Actor, Staniszewski's Believing is Seeing, Morrison's Playing in the Dark and Shawn's The Fever. Most important, students develop their own insight, vision and creativity, their own commitment to art and social action through brief writing assignments and class presentations.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2005 \u00ab",

In the realms of advertising, policymaking, politics, academia, and everyday talk, \"globalization\" references the sense that we are now living in a deeply and ever-increasingly interconnected, mobile, and speeded-up world that is unprecedented, fueled by technological innovations and geopolitical and economic transformations. Drawing on perspectives from history, anthropology, cultural and literary studies, geography, political economy, and sociology, this course will explore theories, discourses, and experiences of globalization. Running through the course are three central concerns: 1) exploring claims about the \"new-ness\" of globalization from historical perspectives, 2) examining how a variety of social and cultural worlds mediate globalization and 3) analyzing a contested politics of globalization in which the opportunities for social mobility and transformation are pitted against renewed intensifications of exploitation and vulnerability along long-standing vectors of difference and inequality.  While \"globalization\" is often touted as a \"flattening\" of the world, this course moves beyond such clich\u00e9s to understand the intersection between large-scale transformations in political economy and culture in and through multiple cultural worlds situated unevenly on the world's map.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2014 \u00ab",

We will explore theories emphasizing structural or ?material? determinism, as well as intellectual currents privileging ?cultural? explanations.  Excessive emphasis on the cultural unhelpfully blurs the economic and other aspects of social life, while reductive fixation on economic moorings suggests subordination of social life to the structural imperatives of the market.  The course proposes the conceptual exploration and development of an integrative middle way, toward a more dialectically nuanced understanding of human behaviors, social interactions and their forms of subjectivity.  The central question will be: how are hegemonic meanings produced and made to become a ?normal? part of our political, intellectual, and moral life?  And how do such meaning-making processes shape the organization of spaces, policies and population within dominant discourses of modernity and development, as well as the emergence of forms of resistance to these economic imaginaries and practices. We will analyze the ?cultural political economy? problem, or culture and society, within four possible analytical frameworks: 1. The problem of nationalism and religion.  2. The problem of everyday life.  3. The problem of culture and human rights.  4. The problem of state theory. Reading will include selections from the works of Antonio Gramsci, Eugen Weber, Michel Foucault, Talal Asad, Michel de Certeau, Amartya Sen, James Scott, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and Karl Marx.

In this context, and drawing on perspectives from history, literature, philosophy, and political and critical theory, this seminar will take up the difficulties of speaking and writing about silence in order to consider the importance of what is unsaid or unsayable for our formation as subjects.  How are our psyches and social worlds formed around a multitude of silences--traumatic, enforced, and/or enabling? In Western philosophy and political thought silence has often been figured as the Other of speech and reason, and cast as the domain of the abject or excluded, or associated with catastrophic experiences at the limits of human reason (including the extremities of pain, violence, and death).  In the context of this Continental tradition we will familiarize ourselves with recent scholarship on testimony and the \u201cunspeakable,\u201d while also critiquing the assumption that silence is necessarily solipsistic or signals only the failure of speech or freedom.  Some silences are enjoined or imposed; others, like the recent silent protests of the indignados in Spain and Greece, propose alternative politics and constitute their own communities.  Throughout we will consider how critique can help us recognize and account for the operations of silence and those other concealed or disavowed forces that are in fact inseparable from the everyday workings of language, knowledge, and ideology.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2019 \u00ab",

This course is intended as an advanced introduction to interdisciplinary study.  The conjunction of the two terms of our title, one a temporal marker, one designating an ontological-epistemological  category, will not only provide us with a kind of laboratory for thinking interdisciplinarily. Questions we will pursue include: What kind of category is the \"human?\" How does it get constructed? On the basis of what exclusions does it get constructed? How have authors across an array of fields articulated the boundaries between human and nature, human and animal? What are some competing models challenging the humanisms that have underwritten so many modern assumptions? Authors whose work we may examine will include Immanuel Kant, Thomas Paine, Mary Shelley, Karl Marx, H.G.Wells, Bruno Latour, Nikolas Luhmann, Michel  Foucault, Donna Haraway, and Judith Butler.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2021 \u00ab",

This proseminar is designed for students interested in the visual, literary or performing arts.  It is primarily intended for practicing artist/scholars who wish to explore how criticism may productively influence their creative process as well as understand their artwork and the role of criticism in a broader historical and theoretical context.  In this class we will survey a range of readings that reveal issues about the history and changing purposes of criticism.  Central to our  exploration, however, is the requirement that each student create a piece of art (a screenplay, musical composition, painting, theatre performance, or other medium determined by the student\u2019s concentration), which will receive criticism at various stages of development from a wide hierarchy of sources: peer, faculty, critics and experts in the field.  Over the course of the semester, students will further develop their artwork in response to critique, while concurrently writing critically about their own work and work of their classmates.  This iterative process of creation and criticism will provide an opportunity to deeply examine, through both theory and practice, the intersections between artist, audience, scholar and critic.   Readings may include: John Berger\u2019s Ways of Seeing; Hans Hofmann\u2019s Search for the Real; George Bernard Shaw\u2019s The Sanity of Art; Tolstoy\u2019s What is Art?; Oscar Wilde\u2019s The Critic as Artist; Liz Lerman\u2019s Critical Response; Richard Schechner\u2019s Between Theatre & Anthropology; W.M.

And yet each situation is shaped by a complex intersection of social forces, individual personalities, moment-to-moment decisions, cultural memes, and institutional histories. This course, designed for MA students in the social sciences and professions, will introduce them to a variety of ways of understanding and analyzing these sorts of quotidian experiences. We will examine talk and non-verbal behavior as they inform activities and relationships; we will look at the ways practical intelligence operates in different situations; we will track cultural differences in everyday behavior. We will consider the ways in which larger social structures and processes \u2013 class, race, gender, and so on \u2013 are produced, performed, and changed in the course of everyday life, as well as the ways they shape people\u2019s actions and thoughts. Along the way, we will tackle such issues as human agency vs. structural determinism; the processes of social change; and the construction of identity, self, and nation. While the immediate purpose of the course is to unpack the dynamics of everyday life, the larger goal is to consider several broad approaches to social theory and research: the positivist, the interpretivist, and the poststructuralist. These explorations will give students an opportunity to try out various perspectives on their own studies and professional work, and may move them toward clearer conceptions of their theses.

The class will explore the different premises, logics and arguments of various schools of thought.  Moreover, members will conduct pilot-level research using methods appropriate to their problematics: e.g., ethnographic observations, interviews, discourse analysis, document study, visual anthropology, psychometric tests, and/or case studies.  The course will be a useful preliminary for students expecting to do a research thesis focused on questions about the social world.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2025 \u00ab",

The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work.  These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres.  The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world.  The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity.  Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work.  Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek.  Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.\n\n      less description for CORE-GG 2026 \u00ab",

The course includes assignments that explore your existing strategies and subject matter in order to understand what has motivated and generated the work thus far. Other assignments push students to work against the grain of their usual modes in order to discover new ways of working and to undermine default strategies. Towards the end of the term, the accumulated insights will be channeled into writing about your work that will be useful in the future context of an artist\u2019s statement or artistic aims essay. In the personal and lab-like atmosphere that this course hopes to cultivate, the class also aims to connect Gallatin graduate students to each other\u2019s work and practice, and to take advantage of the enormous importance that peer input and critique can have on work in progress.
