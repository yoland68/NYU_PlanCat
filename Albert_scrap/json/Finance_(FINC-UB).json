Investment opportunities in emerging financial markets around the world are examined in the context of performance optimization and global risk diversification against a typical backdrop of high per capita income growth, low leverage, favorable demographics, accelerating urbanization, and improving transparency at both the macro-policy and corporate governance levels. Challenges considered include political risk, currency risk, asymmetric information, speculative pressure, and market manipulation. Liquidity limitations, legal constraints, and varying accounting rules and standards also pose challenges to emerging market investors. These unique challenges also provide unique opportunities not available in developed markets. Asset classes range from equities, currencies, bonds, and derivatives to real estate and private equity. Class discussion and reading focus on both the theoretical background as well as practical knowledge necessary to successfully navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of emerging and frontier market investing. The course also includes a select group of guest speakers who share their firsthand knowledge and accounts of investing and operating in emerging markets.\n\n      less description for FINC-UB   23 \u00ab",

Some mechanisms are new (the open electronic limit order book)\u037e some are as old as antiquity (the single price call auction). We have a general sense that all markets are heading toward some sort of electronic future, but the speed of progress and convergence varies widely. Our\nmarkets are infused with tensions between efficiency and fairness, competition and regulation, consolidation and fragmentation, speed and stability, and so on.\nThe course is based on a realistic picture of the trading process, so we go into a fair amount of institutional detail, as well as some law and market regulation. The intellectual framework for the material comes from mainstream economics, financial economics, and the newer subfield of financial economics known as market microstructure.\n\n      less description for FINC-UB   49 \u00ab",

This industry is centered in capital markets which today represent more than $220 trillion of market value, most of which has been raised and is traded outside the United States. The top ten global wholesale banks, which account for 75% of all new issue activity, are comprised of five US and five European banks. All of these banks look to business opportunities and market developments beyond their home countries for their future development. For example, the Euromarket for bonds, stocks and derivatives now represents about half of the new issue value of all global securities, and the prospects of higher growth rates and market reforms in China, India, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia have caused banks to allocate considerable resources to these \u201cemerging markets.\u201d Meanwhile, the future of the global banking industry has been confused and complicated by the consequences and aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the most economically damaging since the 1930s. The ability of banks to compete in the new market environment of the post-crisis era is still being shaped by important regulatory changes and political events in the US, Europe and Asia. This course addresses all of these issues for students interested in global financial services and markets. It addresses differences between investment banking practices and competition in the US and the other market areas, it focuses on how international regulatory and other changes since the crisis will affect the ability of banks to compete effectively on the global stage, and how these factors will affect their business strategies and ability to satisfy shareholders and other investors.\n\n      less description for FINC-UB   87 \u00ab",
