This course offers both a critical examination of family in the United States and a survey of the academic disciplines that study it. As we will see, legal, social, and personal definitions of family are fluid because historical processes such as slavery, immigration, feminism, and gay liberation re-shape popular conceptualizations of family. Similarly, disciplines such as history, sociology, biology, law, literature, and literary theory routinely offer new and sometimes contradictory ways of understanding family. This course will use these disciplines to illuminate the complicated ideas and emotions that can surround what arguably are our closest relationships. Works we may study include Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Octavia Butler's Kindred, Eric Klinenberg's Going Solo, Adrienne Rich's Of Woman Born, and the photography of Sally Mann.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   35 \u00ab",

The central aim of this course is to introduce students to the methods and materials of bibliographic and archival research as they develop and support their own theoretic arguments about this pivotal work. Written assignments (papers, research journal and final project) will be generated from responses to Shakespeare?s text(s), critical theories, dramatic interpretations, individual literary analysis and secondary research.

In India villagers forced to relocate to make way for dams risk death by squatting on slowly-flooding lands. In Venezuela men jailed for years before seeing trial sew shut their lips to demand justice. As international development agendas peg the spread of democracy to the rise of global ?civil society,? how do we make sense of these ?uncivil? acts? This course examines the function of incivility in modern political thought and practice, drawing from the works of Machiavelli and Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, Thoureau and Tocqueville, Putnam and Fukuyama, Chartejee and }i~ek. The goal is to trace how ?civil society? has come to define what constitutes legitimate political action in democracy, in the process marginalizing as illegitimate forms of action that appear uncivil. Then, by examining contemporary case studies, we will assess how culture and history blur the boundaries between civility and incivility in the pursuit of effective government, asking: What currents of social capital underlay the exercise of incivility, and how might they be incorporated into a common language of democratization for the twenty first century? Is there a place for incivility in modern democracy, or has irreverence become irrelevant?\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   57 \u00ab",

Drawing on perspectives from history, anthropology, cultural and literary studies, geography, political economy, and sociology, this course will explore theories, discourses, and experiences of globalization. Running through the course are three central concerns: 1) exploring claims about the \"new-ness\" of globalization from historical perspectives, 2) examining how a variety of social and cultural worlds mediate globalization and 3) analyzing a contested politics of globalization in which the opportunities for social mobility and transformation are pitted against renewed intensifications of exploitation and vulnerability along long-standing vectors of difference and inequality.   While \"globalization\" is often touted as a \"flattening\" of the world, this course moves beyond such clichs to understand the intersection between large-scale transformations in political economy and culture and multiple cultural worlds situated unevenly on the world's map.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   64 \u00ab",

Explanations of war and peace have been especially important in the last one hundred years, the bloodiest in human history. All told, as many as 170 million people died in wars in the twentieth century. In addition to the dead, there are the wounded and survivors, who struggle with the loss and destruction left in war?s wake. The sheer pervasiveness and devastation of armed conflict in our time prompts fundamental questions about the nature and purpose of war. Why do countries go to war? Is there such a thing as a good war? Can war be prevented, and if so, how? We will explore these and related questions through classical as well as modern texts in political theory, history, literature, and film. Readings will include Thucydides, Grotius, Kant, Arendt, Morgenthau, Heller, Ehrenreich, and Sontag.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   66 \u00ab",

Considerations of class are often introduced as part of the critical triumvirate of race/ gender/ class, but a critical engagement with poverty can also confound these categories and expose some of the blind spots and hierarchies that inform conventional notions of social difference and identity. Does poverty pose a unique representational and ideological crisis for the United States, where profound structural inequality and pervasive doctrines of social equality converge? Our primary readings will focus on American authors?Herman Melville, Tillie Olsen, Richard Wright, James Agee, Dorothy Allison?who are particularly self-conscious about the problems poverty poses for aesthetics as well as politics.

These sites\u2014porous and formidable\u2014are the cause of much movement, anxiety and debate. This course takes boundaries as a lens through which to think about identity formation, community building and transgressions. It will begin with a broad exploration of boundary-making, subjectivities and imperial formations, and then address more specific dynamics of national demarcations (with special attention paid to U.S. and Haiti/Dominican Republic frontiers). The following questions guide the semester: How are boundaries imagined into existence and made to matter in the daily lives of different peoples? And, how can transgression and its consequences be understood? Readings might include Edwidge Danticat\u2019s The Farming of Bones, Frederick Jackson Turner\u2019s The Significance of the Frontier in American History, and texts by Sigmund Freud, Amy Kaplan, Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Julia Kristeva.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   69 \u00ab",

Readings will include Beowulf, the Perceval legends of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Robert de Boron\u2019s Merlin, and Thomas Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur. We will examine our modern associations of the Grail legend with Christian femininity, the Knights Templar, the Papacy, and Leonardo da Vinci.

This course explores these questions by reading plays from three periods in which theatrical production played a significant role in the politics of its world\u2014ancient Greece, Renaissance England, and our contemporary globalized world. The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to plays that not only address a range of political issues (for example, about race, gender, sexuality, class, violence, the governing of subjects, and the production of good citizens) but also attempt to enact change and engage the community. We will thus be reading innovative plays alongside theorists who investigate and imagine the political potential of theatre and performance. By attending plays and participating in experimental theatrical exercises ourselves, we will be able both to think about what makes theatre political and to experience its effects through our own creative actions. We will make at least one trip to the theatre together, and students will be encouraged to explore alternative theatrical sites in NYC. Likely playwrights we will study include: Sophocles, Shakespeare, Brecht, Ngugi wa Thiong'o & Ngugi wa Mirii, Anna Deveare Smith, Caryl Churchill, Clifford Odets, and Sara Kane.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   71 \u00ab",

Thus, in addition to thinking about the meaning of play as a universal human activity and contextualizing examples of popular games from the Chinese tradition with background reading on related philosophical and cosmological beliefs, we will learn the fundamentals of the ancient Chinese game of weiqi (Go), a favorite pastime of scholars since the Han dynasty. Students will be introduced to on-line resources that allow them to play the game in real time with opponents from around the world, and they will also visit local New York City Go clubs. Through diligent study, students will be expected to achieve a reasonable level of competence in the game and asked to demonstrate that for a portion of their final grade. By demanding immersion in an absorbing and characteristically Chinese activity that has remained essentially unchanged over at least two millennia, it is hoped that students will begin to recognize the fundamental humanity they share with the former peoples of Early China. Readings may include Homo Ludens by J. Huizinga, Man, Play and Games by Roger Caillois, selections from Science and Civilization in China by Joseph Needham, The Art of War by Sun-tzu, and The Master of Go by Yasunari Kawabata.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   77 \u00ab",

Why then are big science fiction movies like Star Wars and Avatar so successful at the box office? Is the sci-fi genre simply a social lubricant for the acceptance of science? Do these fictional narratives prophetically predict innovations within the sciences or do they actually serve to inspire these innovations? At its core, the sci-fi genre emerges from the interlacing of scientific rationality and the escapism of story-telling, extrapolating current scientific knowledge into alternate realities. In this seminar we will explore the genre of science fiction and its underlying literary and scientific elements. Students will write two expository essays and a short story. Readings may include works by: Voltaire, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, Arthur C. Clarke, Orson Scott Card, Alice Sheldon, Kurt Vonnegut, Octavia Butler, H.G. Wells, Philip K.

But why do we produce images, and what sorts of meaning do images produce? Through readings in anthropology, philosophy, and the histories of art and science, this course steeps you in an intellectual history of the image while introducing you to the analysis of visual culture. We begin with cave paintings, religious icons, the notion of graven images, and iconoclasm, to consider the controversial status of images between the sacred and the profane, life-likeness and death. Next, we track the relationship between knowledge and vision through Renaissance painting, the 19th-century urbanism of light and glass, and the politics of spectacle and surveillance. We then return to painting with Abstract Expressionism as a case study: how can non-representational pictures express\u2014and sometimes move viewers to tears?

This course has two aims: on one hand to decipher how Latin America has conventionally been imagined, by introducing students to major themes in the region\u2019s study like mestizaje and machismo, authoritarianism and revolution, dependency and industrialization; on the other hand to question how valid these imaginaries remain against the backdrop of contemporary examples of social, political, and economic transformation in Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil, and elsewhere. Readings draw widely from academic articles in history, anthropology, and political science, excerpts from memoirs and contemporary journalism, and samplings of music and visual arts, generating thematic student projects asking: is it time to re-imagine Latin America in this new century, and if so, how? Authors include Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Gabriela Mistral, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, Hermano Vianna, and Mariano Azuela.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   88 \u00ab",

An encounter with a double is an intimation of immortality, of the body\u2019s survival beyond its limits, which reminds the self of its own demise. A double is also the outward projection of internal division, a copy that displaces the original, continuity that tears the fabric of rationality. This class will explore the ambivalence of the double by examining its repeated appearances in literature, photography and film, psychoanalysis and critical theory. We will consider doubling as magic, a practice of making resemblances that live a borrowed life. Freud\u2019s concept of the uncanny explains the double as our confrontation with what we failed to keep hidden from ourselves, the return of the repressed. In Lacan's theory of the mirror stage, we form our ego by imitating our own reflection, longing for an image of bodily coherence that we can never match.  In photography and film, doubling defines the very nature of the medium, which simultaneously copies the world and causes it to disappear. We will consider the camera itself as a double, a mechanical eye that positions the viewer\u2019s gaze and projects it onto the film. Students will write several analytic essays exploring these views of the double through close readings of texts on the syllabus.  Readings may include essays by Rank, Freud, Kofman, Benjamin, Taussig, Lacan, Mulvey, and Silverman; fiction by Borges, Poe, Conrad, Hoffmann, Shelley, Wilde, and Woolf; photography and films by Arbus, Hitchcock, and Mulvey.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   89 \u00ab",

We will ask how different disciplines grapple with the challenge of authority and obedience\u2014for instance, how political theory imagines the \u201csovereign,\u201d how literature erects archetypes of temptation, and how psychoanalysis imagines the prohibitions we carry within ourselves. We will also track these tropes and figures through history, asking how the rules, the rulers, and the ruled change over time (and how and why they might). How do our ideas about what constitutes obedience and disobedience shift? When we enter into a relationship (or a culture!) with foundational rules and preconditions, how does this enable, diminish or, some might suggest, even destroy our freedom? And what happens when the promises we\u2019ve made conflict with each other and make it impossible to obey one command without disobeying another? Our readings will include, in addition to earlier and later works, Immanuel Kant\u2019s \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?,\u201d Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s The Social Contract, Charles Perrault\u2019s \u201cBluebeard,\u201d Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s The Wrongs of Woman, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s Fear and Trembling, and Sigmund Freud\u2019s Totem and Taboo.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   91 \u00ab",

Yet domestic spaces and intimate lives can often serve as spaces of relief, refuge, and even political opposition. The home, depending on where one finds oneself situated, can mean wildly different things: prison or refuge, the banal or the aspirational. In this course we will read critiques and adulations of the domestic in multiple genres (theoretical, literary, popular) alongside contemporary activist projects and artworks that willfully put the domestic on public display through the use of traditional women\u2019s work (knitting, embroidery, sewing). We will ask how different domestic spaces and intimate relations are imagined in opposition (or conjunction) with dominant models. Readings will include Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Betty Friedan, Toni Morrison, bell hooks, Kathleen Stewart, Ann Cvetkovich, David Eng, Juana Maria Rodriguez, and Foucault and artworks by Annette Messager, Marianne J\u00f8rgensen, and the Gees Bend Quilters.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG   93 \u00ab",

How do artists, in turn, shape their societies\u2019 attitudes and values? Focusing on how art and writing reveal the effects of race, gender, sexuality, and politics in the second half of the twentieth century, we will consider a number of works in their contexts. Using writing as a way of thinking critically, students will produce descriptive, analytical, and literary-critical essays. Readings may include works by Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Sylvia Plath, Andy Warhol, Susan Sontag, and Joan Didion.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  323 \u00ab",

We read and write about some of the many varieties of metamorphosis, such as those linked with disguise and dissimulation; madness and dissolution; immigration and exile; sickness and healing; and self-creation that reflects self-knowledge. Students write academic essays that develop their own ideas in their own voices, in stages that progress from freewriting and drafting to workshopping, revising and polishing. Throughout the course, we reflect on writing itself as a transformation of subjective, ephemeral impressions into words fixed on paper (or shimmering in cyberspace) through which we communicate with others. Readings include selections from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses (Humphries trans.) and a contemporary play based on it by Mary Zimmerman; fairy tales, folk tales and contemporary revisions (ed. Maria Tatar); Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis; essays on neurological transformation and creative responses to it in Oliver Sacks\u2019s An Anthropologist on Mars; and essays on immigration and exile in Letters of Transit (ed. Andre Aciman).\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  324 \u00ab",

In this course, students will use their writing to examine the causal landscape of American mobility through fiction, non-fiction, and film, paying close attention to the roles of race, gender, and class in negotiating the social and political terrain of American life. Questions we will consider include who has the right or ability to move? How does movement respond to the exigencies of urban or rural life? How does a text re-map America through movement? How does geographic movement correspond to social mobility? We will explore imaginative depictions of vertical and horizontal movement, focusing on themes such as westward exploration, the Great Migration, immigration, the road trip, the fugitive, and border crossing. Framing our discussions will be questions about the national and global implications of such re-mappings. Students will write a series of short descriptive and analytical essays and a longer literary critical paper. Possible authors include Oscar Zeta Acosta, Bonnie Bremser, Willa Cather, Jack Kerouac, Jamaica Kincaid, Vladimir Nabokov, and Richard Wright. Films may include Easy Rider and Into the Wild.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  354 \u00ab",

Lost, not only in the city, but within himself as well.\" Describing his protagonist's relationship to New York in his novel City of Glass, Paul Auster articulates the way in which the city has frequently been the location of a search for the self. From the great wave of immigration in the early twentieth century all the way through the end of the millennium, New York has beckoned as a site where people come to lose or rediscover themselves, the life unfolding within its \"inexhaustible space\" reflecting not only intense personal upheavals but also larger historical shifts. In this class, we will use our own writing to explore twentieth- and twenty-first-century narratives about New York, and to consider how individual experiences of the city intersect with broader historical conditions. Through regular informal writing as well as a series of finished essays, we will examine stories of how New York has inspired euphoria and dejection, contentment and restlessness, exhilarating feelings of belonging or unrelenting isolation. Authors we will read may include James, Wharton, Singer, Hurston, Baldwin, Kazin, Ellison, Didion, Auster, Alexander, and others.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  355 \u00ab",

What new meanings do the fragments and quotations acquire from these radical juxtapositions, and how does their assemblage contest the mythologies of the culture from which they were taken? The class will consist of several case studies in verbal and visual collage placed in relation to a set of political and aesthetic ideas, which we will derive from a series of theoretical texts. Theorists may include Roland Barthes, Viktor Shklovsky, John Berger, Dawn Ades, Peter B\u00fcrger, Marjorie Perloff, and Dick Hebdige. Collages may include poetry by T. S.

Theoretical readings will include works of cultural studies scholars, social theorists, and musicologists such as Robert Walser, Tricia Rose, George Lipsitz, Susan McClary, Tia DeNora, Richard Middleton, Simon Frith, Kevin Dettmar, Greil Marcus, Chuck Klosterman, and Dick Hebdige.\n\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  369 \u00ab",

Math, logical reasoning, and subject-specific technical jargon can form intimidating barriers to modern scientific understanding. Why then are big science fiction movies like Star Wars and Avatar so successful at the box office? Is the sci-fi genre simply a social lubricant for the acceptance of science? Do these fictional narratives prophetically predict innovations within the sciences or do they actually serve to inspire these innovations? At its core, the sci-fi genre emerges from the interlacing of scientific rationality and the escapism of story-telling, extrapolating current scientific knowledge into alternate realities. In this seminar we will explore the genre of science fiction and its underlying literary and scientific elements. Students will write, workshop and revise three essays and a literary critical essay.

Accounts of the Rising have been used in subsequent periods to forward political agendas, raising questions of how such rebellion should be narrated and understood. This course will examine how such historical events can be harnessed to contemporary agendas, and how remembering the past can often be an important part of determining the future. Students will be asked to engage in larger questions about the nature of revolution and rebellion, such as: How do protestors represent themselves or create a narrative of collective dissent? How do rebellions or protests use, affect, and transform collective narratives of nationhood? How do the stories of individuals figure into the story of a nation, a group, or an era? How do protests effectively use the historical past to make assertions about the present? And how do writings about protests affect both the protest and how we remember it? We will focus on the Rising (and the rebel leader Wat Tyler), the French Revolution, and the recent Arab Spring; readings may include Chaucer, Gower, Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, Robert Southey, Barbara Salert, Jack Goldstone, Alaa Al-Aswany, Nazih Ayubi, Ahdaf Soueif, as well as videos and other social media sources relating to the Arab Spring.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  386 \u00ab",

In addition to reading and comparing translations of literary texts, we will engage with theoretical works about translation, statements written by translators about their craft and profession, and recent news articles about the politics of translation and translation in politics. In various essays and projects, students will be encouraged to pursue a range of topics that reflect their interests and curiosities about language and intercultural exchange.

We will also explore the larger question of how valuing collaboration might speak to our digital reading and writing practices. We will build our own writing communities, first in a digital space where students will compose short writing assignments and comment on others\u2019 reflections. Then, students will work through the writing process together to compose a series of longer essays around a central theme and collaboratively write an introduction that links all the pieces together. Texts may include selections from the following communities, collectives, and groupings: Transcendental Club, Bloomsbury, Harlem Renaissance, modernists, Confessional School, second-wave feminists, zine culture.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  399 \u00ab",

How can portraiture expose the ways that a society classifies its people, establishes its hierarchies and presents its value systems? In addition to examining portraiture as an art practice, we will explore it as a vernacular and ritual form in diverse time periods and geographical locations. We will devote some attention to the practice of street photography as well as to the formation of iconic images and the representational politics of figures including Mussolini, Che Guevara and Ho Chi Minh. We will consider what influences different and transforming media technologies have on representing people and the self. In two five-page essays and three drafts of a 10-page final essay, students will develop academic writing and rhetorical skills through an engagement with visual and textual material. Course material may include essays or works by Italo Calvino, George Simmel, Vivian Maier, Michel Foucault, Richard Brilliant, Nancy Burson, Graham Clarke, Geoffrey Batchen and James Elkins.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  400 \u00ab",

In the course of exploring the link between animals and language, we will pay special attention to our own writing. We will discuss the construction of analytical and critical arguments, and ask some fascinating questions along the way. What does it mean to write about writing? What is at stake when we take a piece of literature as an object of study? In addition to Genesis and Book I of Aristotle\u2019s Politics, our readings may include selections from the fables of Aesop and La Fontaine; Gulliver\u2019s Travels (Jonathan Swift); selections from the poetry of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley; Frankenstein (Mary Shelley); selections from On the Origin of Species (Charles Darwin); and Elizabeth Costello (J.M.

From what was arguably the first instance of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u201d the \"mean streets\" of the city have been crucial to the formation of the genre. The detective moves between different social spaces within the city, with access to both expensive high-rise apartments and crack dens, and the city itself becomes a kind of character in the novel \u2013 alternatively helpful, seductive, sullen, and dangerous. Using short stories, novellas, TV shows and films set in London, Baltimore, Johannesburg, Kolkata, New York, Paris, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, and other world cities, we will both examine the art of detective writing and trace the narrative complicity of the detective and urban space. Alongside the fictional texts, writings by practitioners of crime fiction as well as urban and cultural critics will provide us with the theoretical scaffolding for our investigation.  One of the authors we'll be reading, Paul Auster, argues that \u201c[t]he detective is the one who looks, who listens, who moves through this morass of objects and events in search of the thought, the idea that will pull all these things together and make sense of them. In effect, the writer and the detective are interchangeable.\u201d In learning about detective fiction, we will thus also be sharpening our own writing skills, working out how to most effectively express that one idea that pulls everything together. Shorter writing assignments during the course of the semester will focus on close reading, with a longer, argumentative essay as the final assignment.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  406 \u00ab",

In this first-year writing seminar, we will explore some of the central questions raised both by war itself and the various types of activism that have historically arisen to challenge its power. What kinds of people become involved in the efforts to stop war? What types of strategies and activities have they developed? And, perhaps most importantly, what impact have their actions had on the operation of not only of the war in Vietnam, but also on the direction of war and peace in the decades that followed? Through readings, class discussions, and writing exercises that lead to formal essays, this course will employ methodologies drawn from disciplines like film and literary studies, cultural theory, and political science to write and think through the complex moral, philosophical, political, and aesthetic elements involved in antiwar activism. Texts and films may include works by T.V. Reed (The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from the Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle), Peter Davis (Hearts and Minds), Penny Lewis (Hardhats, Hippies, and Hawks: The Vietnam Antiwar Movement as Myth and Memory), Nick Turse (Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam), Diane di Prima (Revolutionary Letters), David Maraniss (They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace, America and Vietnam, October 1967), and David S. Meyer (The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America).\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  408 \u00ab",

It is often taken for granted that telling one\u2019s story can have a cathartic effect. This presumption has grounded both individual and collective approaches to recovery from trauma in a wide range of contexts over the last fifty years. On this model, narrating one\u2019s experience of victimization\u2014be it in a courtroom, documentary film, or memoir\u2014is presumed to help set one free from psychic pain and from histories of oppression and violence. This course will attempt to deconstruct the trope of narrative as catharsis with respect to specific case studies, including truth commissions, war crimes tribunals, feminist anti-violence campaigns, and postcolonial movements. It will explore this theme using different theoretical, methodological and critical \u201clenses,\u201d such as feminist narrative scholarship, critical race theory, trauma theory, transitional justice, and postcolonial theory. At stake are the presumptions about humans\u2019 ability to heal, their capacity to access the truth, the possibility of recovery following violence, and the power relations at work in different post-traumatic scenes of narration. The course theme will serve as the framework for developing students\u2019 analytic thinking, reading, and writing skills, and provide the basis for class discussions and assignments. In addition to weekly responses, students will be required to write one long and three short analytic papers related to the course theme. Readings may include works by Sigmund Freud, Martin Luther King Jr., Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, Shoshana Felman, Desmond Tutu, Veena Das, and Martha Minow.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  410 \u00ab",

Focusing on a diverse set of cities from around the world such as New Delhi, Jakarta, Mexico City, Lagos, New York, and Rio de Janerio, in this course we will examine urban inequality and citizen struggles for right to the city. We will examine different forms of inequality in global urban contexts and learn about various practices and strategies of resistance from encroachment to urban social movements. We will pay attention to how gender, caste, sexuality, class, age, and generations shape experiences of the city and of urban change. Through a range of writing assignments, student will develop and practice their skills in argumentative writing across genres, as well as, critical thinking, constellational thinking, and close analytical reading.

How should we think of photography\u2014as a means by which we can actually see things and people in situations that no longer exist or as simply a means of registering the world? What is it about film that gives the medium its peculiar illusion-making power? What exactly is music? Does it represent and express in the same way as other art forms? What value is there in popular music and television?  Readings will be drawn from Benjamin, Danto, Eco, Gombrich, Greenberg, Heidegger, Kant, Kivy, Plato, Scruton, and others.

How have writers and activists sought to change society through changing how we use language? How is rhetoric used politically, in essays, law, oratory, propaganda, and poetry? We read arguments about the interplay of language and the political, think about political theory, examine political rhetoric, and study literary works. We write about the power of rhetoric to form and criticize political practices: movements for civil rights, human rights, rights for women, workers\u2019 rights, and animal rights. We investigate in detail how language participates in our ideas about rights, ethics, political action, and social justice.  And we examine the affective dimensions of this interaction of language, ideas, and values.  After familiarizing ourselves with various approaches to thinking about political and social relations, you can then explore in depth an issue of social justice that animates you. This means that we will use the reading to focus your critical thinking capacities, expand your horizons, and communicate the results of these processes in writing that is persuasive, coherent, exhilarating, meaningful. Readings may include works by Plato, Alice Walker, Thomas Jefferson, Karl Marx, Margaret Fuller, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi, Hannah Arendt, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Malcolm X, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Ursula LeGuin.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  709 \u00ab",

Whether deprivation or overload, sensory experience at once invites description and eludes understanding, challenging writers and scientists alike.  This class explores the mechanics as well as the poetics of perception.  Students develop individual research topics from diverse disciplines, such as literature, music, neuroscience, art, philosophy, and mysticism. Color, pain, synesthesia, umami, disgust, the sublime, phantom limbs, and \"non-lethal\" weaponry will be some phenomena we look into.  Readings may include works by Franz Kafka, Isadora Duncan, J.-K. Huysmans, Gertrude Stein, Marcel Proust, Caroline Walker Bynum, Oliver Sacks, and Virginia Woolf.  Films and excursions will supplement the readings.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  727 \u00ab",

Students will write three analytic essays and a longer research essay as they explore some of the following questions: Why are these conflicts desirable to adventurers and to those who admire them? How do these often masculine narratives represent women and domesticity, especially when dealing with women adventurers? How do they represent the people who populate the adventurous landscape? Are adventurers ultimately imperial or anti-social? Theoretical sources may include Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Mariana Torgovnick, William Cronon, and Frederick Jackson Turner.

It is axiomatic that an examination of a specific culture or period of history will deepen one\u2019s understanding of the literature produced in that culture, especially works that are presumed \u201cto reflect\u201d the period. However, in recent decades interdisciplinary inquiry has turned to literature to study culture and, more specifically, how a fictional work interprets, reinforces, challenges and shapes culture. New Historicist critic Stephen Greenblatt coined this approach the \u201cPoetics of Culture\u201d to denote the interaction between literary production and other social practices, to bridge the divide between literary and non-literary texts, and to blur the distinctions between that which is \u201cwithin a text\u201d and that \u201cwhich lies outside.\u201d   In addition to reading historical novels, documentary fiction, and docudrama, we will bring a historical and cultural analysis to literary works that seem a world apart from political conflicts, history-making events, or even daily life as we imagine it. Readings will juxtapose fiction and film with contemporary non-literary texts, including historical documents, essays, and journalistic accounts.  The readings will serve as sources for critical essays that will lead to a final research project. Class time will also be devoted to identifying a research question, locating source materials, incorporating sources into a clearly developed argument, and reading drafts in the revision process. Readings may include texts by Toni Morrison, Stephen Crane, Kate Chopin, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, and Emily Mann.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  732 \u00ab",

Students will debate how groups organized to create and appreciate stories offer a sense of identity in the modern world. For their research projects, students may pursue a variety of topics related to storytelling, such as political speech and propaganda; advertising strategies; ancient epic traditions; preaching and religious parable; folklore; mythology; survivors\u2019 tales; and oral history projects. Students may also wish to conduct more research about the literary, psychological, or anthropological approaches to storytelling that we reviewed earlier in the semester.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  733 \u00ab",

Rather than study a stock textbook version of the Cold War, we will examine interpretations and framings of the conflict that interrogate the very concept, framing, and stakes of the Cold War, as well its relationship to other organizing principles in U.S. and global history. What changes, for example, if we re-frame the Cold War not as an existential battle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but rather as part of a shared Western history of colonial/imperial conquest? What might both Puritans and the U.S. Civil War have to do with the Cold War? How did the Cold War shape twentieth-century literary and cultural theory? What is gained by shifting the framework away from geopolitics to study the role of race, class, and gender in the conflict? How do these alternative frameworks revise our understanding of the Cold War in contemporary politics?

In this first-year research seminar, we will focus on texts that are invested in the relationship between words and images. Specifically, we will examine photographs and drawn images, including comics, as documentary evidence or testimonials, as sites of manipulation and fantasy, and as objects that help us remember as well as forget. Our readings will confront the allure of the visual, prompting us to explore the pulls, as well as the dangers, of believing in what we see. We will use writing to think through these questions, as well as develop clear and original arguments that respond to the ideas of others. Students will hone their research and writing skills, including developing an argument, citing texts, and evaluating and documenting sources, through a series of writing assignments that culminate in a research essay. Readings may include: Susan Sontag\u2019s On Photography, Paul Hendrickson\u2019s Sons of Mississippi, John Berger and Jean Mohr\u2019s A Fortunate Man, Virginia Woolf\u2019s Three Guineas, Roland Barthes\u2019s Image-Music-Text, Art Spiegelman\u2019s Maus I, Joe Sacco\u2019s Safe Area Gorazde, Josh Neufeld\u2019s A/D: New Orleans After the Deluge, and W.G.

By reading Augustine and Abelard as well as ancient legal codes, we will study the origins of the creation of a moral self that was based on the mind, as opposed to observable actions. The poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer will offer an important example of how writers of the period used the idea of individual intent to develop literary character and to represent human subjectivity. Medieval plays that represent the thought crimes of Satan will also provide a platform for thinking about intention and religious or intellectual dissent. We will also explore how studying the roots of these concepts can help us understand the modern world. We will, for example, examine the related problems of just intent in just war theory from its medieval origins to its presence in current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We will read recent literary works by authors such as Junot D\u00edaz and Alice Munro as a way to study intention as both a problematic and a defining element of culpability and the moral self. Finally, modern theories of intention and morality from philosophers and neuroscientists will offer additional theoretical lenses for analyzing the semester\u2019s readings. These topics will form the basis for several short writing assignments and a major research paper.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  745 \u00ab",

In addition to looking at the ways that ancient cultures used their own past to shape a cultural identity, we will also look at the ways in which ancient texts and archaeological remains have been employed in the shaping of modern national identities in Europe, Turkey, and Egypt. For their semester projects, students are invited to apply the questions we encounter in class to a historical period, political context, or geographical region that interests them.

Building on the questions posed by these thinkers, we will investigate visual images and objects in relation to imperial and post-colonial projects in contexts such as India, Egypt, China, Algeria, Viet Nam and The Philippines. Through a series of short research and writing assignments culminating in a research paper on a cultural context and set of images of your own choosing, you will develop your thinking about the issues raised by class material and discussion. In the process, you will develop your research skills, such as locating legitimate sources and integrating authoritative voices into your own work.

Proceeding from the idea that there is a deep resonance between mental forms and architectural spaces and styles, we will begin by looking at the literature, music, and political practices that accompanied the population shift from rural homes to urban apartments in the mid-nineteenth century. Apartment living fostered the development of novel forms of identity like the New (single) Woman, innovative modes of expression like the newspaper, and a host of anxieties about the moral, physical and psychological effects of living in close quarters with strangers. We will trace the legacy of these 19th-century cultural formations through the 20th and 21st century to ask questions about the relationship between modern subjectivity and the spaces we live in. Fiction we will consider includes work by Edith Wharton, Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Kafka and George Saunders. We will also look at the writing of Georg Simmel, Sharon Marcus and Thomas Pynchon; architectural photography and blueprints from the last 150 years; the New York Times real estate section; the films of Woody Allen; and the reality TV show Apartment Hunters.

This course investigates the linkages between identity and place as they are imagined in the aftermath of historical traumas, in film, literature, and theory as well as practices including reparations and genealogy. The ways in which contemporary narratives treat the theme of coming home across boundaries of time and space and the role this idea plays in the construction of ethnic, racial, and national identities will serve as the impetus for frequent exploratory writing, formal essays, and a research paper. Texts will include readings in trauma theory and memory studies as well as selections from Louise Erdrich, Tim O\u2019Brien, Toni Morrison, Jonathan Safran Foer, and James Young, among others.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  802 \u00ab",

To learn about work is to learn how most people spend most of the day, securing means, pursuing dreams, existing in active relation to other people.  How do we come to choose the work we do, and how to assess and redress the injustices that often come with the division of labor?  What are the ethical and economic relationships that bind us to the faraway strangers, or familiar faces we greet everyday, upon whose efforts our own routines rely?  How have artists and writers depicted working people, and in what ways does creative work fit into or fall outside the economy at large?  How has work structured our notions and experience of time?  In this course, students develop individual research projects across diverse disciplines, such as anthropology, philosophy, art history, law, and critical theory, to explore the challenges that work has posed to political thought, political action, and aesthetic representation alike.  Readings drawn from literature, visual culture, intellectual history, and globalization discourse will be supplemented by artworks, films, and the occasional excursion.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  803 \u00ab",

We focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial and ethnic identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity.  Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable?  How do we know it when we see it?  How is it distinct from ethnicity?  What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today?  In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities?  We employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses.  Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper.  Texts include fiction, plays, theory and criticism including, Junot Diaz\u2019s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Edward Said\u2019s Orientalism, Dael Orlandersmith's Yellowman and B.D. Wong's M.

Even Facebook is altering the way we store and remember aspects of our own lives. This seminar aims to bring crucial awareness to these many aspects through readings, discussion, and writing, culminating in a research paper. Assignments include reaction papers and class trips to memorial sites, and students are encouraged to develop a research topic of their interest. Our syllabus features cultural critics such as Benjamin, Huyssen, and Hirsch, in addition to scholars who focus on the Internet, digital archives, and social media.\n\n      less description for FIRST-UG  805 \u00ab",
