Attention will be given to the special character and unique possibilities of each of these format categories, from the responsive immediacy of 35mm to the high-resolution and perspective control of view camera options. Students will learn essential composition and optical principles and metering techniques. Supported by a comprehensive lab facility, students will learn film processing and archival projection print enlarging methods as well as the basics of print finishing and presentation. Classes will incorporate slide lectures of important historical and contemporary imagery, hands-on studio and laboratory demonstrations, critiques of student work and field trips. For those who may wish to combine analog image capture with digital printing alternatives, negative scanning fundamentals will be introduced at the conclusion of the course. There is a lab fee charged for this course.\n\n      less description for PHTI-GT 2001 \u00ab",

Even as digital cameras have replaced 35mm analog cameras, the higher resolution and creative flexibility of medium and large format cameras afford artists the opportunity to render their subjects with greater fidelity and at a larger scale. For some, the more deliberate process of working at a slower pace can significantly enhance their interpretation of portraits, still-lifes and architectural subjects.       \n\nLectures will consist of studio and lab demonstrations, slides presentations of historical and contemporary work, and critiques of assignments. All students will be expected to complete a modest portfolio based on a subject of their own choosing.  Representative medium and large format cameras, as well as tripods and light meters will be provided.  Students will have the opportunity to work in a professional lab with excellent technical support. Those who successfully complete this course can expect to have practical experience with camera operation, advanced metering, film processing for contrast control, analog printing, as well as negative scanning for digital output of their negatives. Demonstration materials will be furnished. Participants will be required to provide film and paper for the execution of their assignments.\n\nThis course is charged a lab fee of $372.00.\n\n      less description for PHTI-GT 2002 \u00ab",

Subjects covered include: Lighting for portraits, still life, fashion, interiors, documentary, and exterior location lighting using battery powered flash. Location scouting and planning according to location limitations. Color temperature and color control.  Light shaping and control. Students will learn how to use:  Digital SLR\u2019s, medium format cameras, Leaf Aptus electronic capture, direct tethered capture using Adobe Lightroom, continuous lighting, electronic flash, color temperature meters and custom white balance profiles as well as the basics of video/sound capture.

Please see the Notes section below.\n\nMany artists turn to 4x5 and 8x10 large-format cameras for the creative control that view cameras afford, as well as for the high resolution and potentially large scale of the resulting prints. This course introduces the special characteristics of large format photography, including perspective control, creative approaches to selective focus and metering strategies facilitated by single negative processing. The exposure and development methods known as the Zone System will also be considered. Because large format work is physically demanding and relatively slow, this is also an opportunity to work more deliberately and, in some respects, more consciously. It may also inform one\u2019s understanding of the methods and approaches of 19th and early 20th Century artists. \n\nThe high resolution of large format description can often produce a compelling image of relatively static subject matter that might not otherwise succeed if recorded in smaller formats. Surfaces and details evoke a more \u201ccomplete\u201d, or even tactile appreciation of some subjects. Following a series of practical exercises during the first half of the course, students are expected to develop an appropriate project on which to concentrate and apply their evolving skills in the production of an original and integrated body of work. Technical material covered includes different large format camera types and applications, lenses and optics, metering, filters, special B&W developers, large format printing and scanning for digital output. Early historical processes are introduced, current exhibitions of artists and photographers in New York are discussed and field trips are arranged. A variety of cameras, lenses and tripods are available for student use.\n\n      less description for PHTI-GT 2014 \u00ab",

The class will talk about image pacing and the flow of text throughout a publication. On the third day of class, homework is reviewed and InDesign files are revised if needed. The class then turns to production. We will go over each file and make it as final as possible and ready for print.  The class will also discuss the different ways to get your document published and how to do each one. In the beginning of this course the students will walk into the classroom with a loose body of work and leave, after the third day, with their work organized into a book format.

We also cover scanning negatives and flat artwork as well as color adjustment using levels and curves. We look at all aspects of image creation and enhancement with equal importance given to the aesthetic effect and technical ease. By working on a creative project, students use the software to convey their ideas in this digital environment. Class time is divided between work-in-progress sessions, critiques, and lectures. Because of the holiday, that session will be rescheduled sometime during the three weeks of class. This course is charged a lab fee.\n\n      less description for PHTI-GT 2245 \u00ab",

Emphasis in this class will be on using Photoshop for image manipulation as well as on graphic design principles and non-destructive image editing techniques. You will learn to construct images from photographic source material, as well as starting from scratch using Photoshop\u2019s design and media tools.  While grounding in the basics of Photoshop and digital photography is assumed, early sessions will review basic tools to expand and better control these fundamental building blocks of digital imaging. Specifically we will explore creating and using layer masks and image effects, creating paths and shapes, custom fills and patterns. We will review working with layers, adjustment layers and text layers, as well as reviewing the details of resizing, sharpening, and image resolution for various output destinations. The course will be project-based with several short assignments and a final project of the students\u2019 choosing.
