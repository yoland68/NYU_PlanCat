Customer relationship management (CRM) systems encompass both software applications and business strategies that anticipate, interpret, and respond to the needs of current and prospective customers. They allow organizations to identify, acquire, serve, and retain profitable customers by interacting with the right customers and providing to them the right offers, through the right channel and at the right time. To achieve such functionality, it is important to have the right mixture of people, processes, and technologies. Modern CRM systems are becoming increasingly more dependent on the right mixtures of technologies and systems that deliver the functionality described above. This course focuses in depth on such technologies and systems. In particular, it covers the systems supporting operational CRM, i.e., the systems that automate front-office customer interactions in sales, marketing, and customer service as well as systems supporting analytical CRM, i.e., the systems that analyze customer activities captured by operational CRM and that provide actionable knowledge about the customers. These technologies include databases, customer-centric warehouses, business intelligence, personalization, data mining, decision support, customer tracking, and profiling technologies. The course also examines how all these CRM technologies enable the functionalities and business strategies described above.\n\n      less description for INFO-GB 2320 \u00ab",

Information technologies are an increasing part of developing new products and services, of integrating business functions, and of managing customer relationships. These technologies can cause major disruptions in business models in a very short time. Decisions about information technology are thus increasingly central to business success. The central premise of this course is that an organization will not succeed with IT investments unless these investments are aligned and integrated with a sensible business model. This is a crucial premise for industries transformed by IT. In more stable, industrial age industries, business models were relatively stable, and the central basis for success with IT investments involved aligning them with complementary organizational and process changes. HWe are at the early stages of an information revolution where information technologies are redefining business models across industries, creating new markets, enabling new functionalities, and creating a whole new space where new human communities, behaviors, norms, and regulation are just beginning to emerge.

The central premise of this course is that an organization will not succeed with IT investments unless these investments are aligned and integrated with a sensible business model. This is a crucial premise for industries transformed by IT. In more stable, industrial age industries, business models were relatively stable, and the central basis for success with IT investments involved aligning them with complementary organizational and process changes. However, when IT transforms an industry, it realigns the industry's structure and boundaries, and changes the fundamental business models that work. The course is case oriented. The cases have been chosen to cover a range of industries and transformations of business models over the last ten years. We also consider Google and the potential impacts of its business model to organize the world's information and make it easily accessible to society and business. (The cases and their associated questions are listed in Appendix 1.) Since the emphasis of the course is on information technologies in business, the course includes a module on the impacts of emerging technologies, namely WiMAX and RFID, to force us to think through issues of industry and business transformation induced by currently emerging technologies. The objective here is to end up with a framework that you will find useful in generalizing to other information technologies. You are required to choose one of these two topics and analyze it using the questions in Appendix 2.This course will not make you an IS technical specialist; its emphasis is on industry and managerial issues. However, through an overview of the technologies, activities, and applications of IS, this course will help you to acquire an appreciation for the possibilities created by IT in tomorrow's markets, organizations and society.\n\n      less description for INFO-GB 3147 \u00ab",

As a result, businesses are under increasing pressure to draft privacy policies and post them on their Web sites. Chief privacy officers are becoming essential members of many enterprises, and companies are taking proactive steps to avoid the potential reputation damage of a privacy mistake. This course provides an overview of online privacy issues, privacy laws, and privacy-related technologies and self-regulatory efforts. Students study the approaches that companies are taking to address their customers' online privacy concerns, as well as review recent privacy blunders. Students also gain an understanding of both privacy-invading and privacy-enhancing technologies. Students are prepared to assess the privacy practices of organizations in order to document these practices in privacy policies (including P3P policies) and to evaluate the implications of these practices for the organization.\n\n      less description for INFO-GB 3156 \u00ab",

Who is using your data, inside your company, with business partners, outsourcers, offshore, why, and when? What policies do you need? How do you govern them? These are key questions that every business executive needs to answer today because data is the raw material of economic growth, and Data Governance is a strategic imperative. There are a lot of myths about Governance. It is not a technology, not something new, not very hard to do, but hard to do very well. Effective Data Governance is a culture of organizational behavior that mitigates risk. It is as much about self-control as it is about quality control, the rule of law and the architecture of regulation. It is the process of balancing appropriate access to information to maximize value creation with control and discipline to manage risk. How an organization strikes that balance impacts employees, customers, business partners, citizens, political institutions, and global networks. Governing data well is a critical challenge for businesses today. Course Content We will begin by exploring the threats to data, including Security, Privacy, Off-shoring, Regulations, Semantics, Fraud, and Operational Risks. We will then look at methods for assessing the value, and inherent, liabilities of data from both business and IT perspectives. We will explore Operational Risk, looking at Basel II definitions and Insurance Professional Liability examples. And we will look at different kinds of IT access controls, such as Firewalls, Roll Based Access Control, Identity Management, Encryption, and Anonymity. Course Objectives: *Understanding Data Governance models *Assessing Data Value and Risk *Managing regulatory requirements, policy and obligations *Evaluating data standards and Master Data Management *Modeling business processes and controls *Measuring and reporting results *Creating consistency and good data governance\n\n      less description for INFO-GB 3358 \u00ab",
