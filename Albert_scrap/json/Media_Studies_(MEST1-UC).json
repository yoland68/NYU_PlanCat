Real World, which premiered on MTV in 1991, has been credited with helping to establish many of the textual characteristics that define the genre of \u201cReality TV,\u201d a form that in less than 20 years has come to dominate the American television landscape. From its inception, Reality TV has ballooned, mushroomed, and mutated into endless hybrids and sub-genres. This course aims to explore questions such as: What are the political and economic environments and ideologies that facilitate not only why and how the programs are produced, but also the audiences\u2019 reactions? How may this fascination or even obsession with the \u201creal\u201d impact the styles and productions of other cultural products? How are the factors of race, class, gender, and sexuality systematically represented in the programs, and what is Realty TV\u2019s social impact?\n\n      less description for MEST1-UC 6032 \u00ab",

This course explores that question by approaching visual images as a language with a particular syntax, grammar, and set of articulations which enable an almost infinite variety of signifying practices. Topics include the shot as the basic unit of film structure; the effects of lighting and composition; editing; mise-en-scene and montage; sound; and overall practices in photography, digital design, and film.",
