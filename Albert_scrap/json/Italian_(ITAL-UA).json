Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell?arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well the ?revisions? that women playwrights and writers make to a largely male-dominated canon.\n\n      less description for ITAL-UA  720 \u00ab",
