We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination \u2013 in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism \u2013 in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms.  While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would \u201cdie out\u201d and later that they would or could be simply \u201cassimilated,\u201d we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called \u201cthe great Australian silence\u201d and asserting their right to a cultural future.  This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.\n\n      less description for MUSST-AD  102J \u00ab",
