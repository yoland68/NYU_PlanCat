From its early iterations and influences in burlesque, vaudeville, and operetta to the complex contemporary amalgams of book, music, lyrics, and dance, the American musical has proven a rich crucible for the exploration of identity and culture, form and content, and ideas and emotions. This arts workshop will offer actors a technical foundation for acting in musical theater. We will deal broadly with the history of musical theater in context by exploring both the process by which actors engage with musical material and the development and aesthetics of the form. Participants will work on songs and scenes taken from the giants of musical theater including: Rodgers & Hammerstein, Kander & Ebb, Stephen Sondheim, and more. How do we merge the receiving nature of acting with the giving nature of singing? How do we \u201cjustify\u201d the decision to sing at all? Our survey of the evolution of musical theater will ask: What does the history of the American musical tell us about our cultural history? What do musicals teach us about the interdisciplinary nature of living in the arts? All students in this course must be comfortable and confident singing actors. Everyone will be required to rehearse outside of class time, complete written and analytical assignments, and commit to a public presentation at the end of the semester. In order to be accepted into this course, attendance at the first class is mandatory for all, including registered students.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1014 \u00ab",

We will investigate several interpretive techniques that help the performer make the connections between the text, mind, and body. Special focus will be given to the development of a strong vocal instrument and bold interpretive choices that embrace the muscularity of the language. We will explore the structure of the language and how the structure helps the performer make sense of the complexities within the text as well as specific choices related to character and action. The course will also feature a screening component where we examine the range of interpretation of the plays as demonstrated in the work of actors and directors by viewing contrasting versions of the same scene from video and film. Students will work on speeches and scenes from the canon and present their work in class. Students will also keep a journal and attend performances of a Shakespearean play in New York City.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1019 \u00ab",

Readings of plays and monologues with a focus on characters will include works by documentary theatre artists, playwrights and solo performers such as Jean Giraudoux, Anna Deveare Smith, Eric Bogosian, Eve Ensler, Moises Kaufman, and Dale Orlander-Smith. Research projects look at several twentieth-century characters?performers, humorists, writers and monologists?including but not limited to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ruth Gordon, Danitra Vance, Lily Taylor, Lord Buckley, Eddie Izzard, Richard Pryor, Judy Holiday, Quentin Crisp, Lily Tomlin. Previous study in one or more of the following is helpful: acting, movement theatre, improvisation, comedy or voice.

The solos will emerge from a process involving improvisation (movement and text), composing, and revision of material. Readings include performance texts by prominent artists, essays on performance, and video viewings, which foreground the tendency in performance to explore subjectivity and identity in light of social and political critique.  Required texts include Jo Bonney\u2019s Extreme Exposure, C. Carr's On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century, and Lenora Champagne\u2019s Out from Under: Texts by Women Performance Artists.  Additional readings include Colin Counsell, \"Postmodernism and Performance Art,\" Roselee Goldberg, \"Performance: A Hidden History,\" Jonathan Kalb, \"Documentary Solo Performance: The Politics of the Mirrored Self,\" and an essay by Coco Fusco.  Assignments include a solo performance created from the material developed in class (rather than \"polishing\" an already created piece), along with a written analysis of two live solo performances, and an oral presentation.

Wednesday classes will be spent discussing readings and planning our work with students at BIHS. We will think and talk about how culture and identity are both influencing and influenced by the matrix of social forces operating in society. Readings will focus on the role of artists in mediating community interactions, community arts pra ctices and the use of the arts for social change. Readings may include Games for Actors and Non-Actors (Boal), Local Acts (Cohen-Cruz), essays on the Community Arts Network and We Are All Suspects Now, (Nguyen).

As site artists confront the matrix of social forces and overlapping communities that relate to a given site, their aesthetics, creative process and goals have shifted. How are they blurring the lines between art and activism, art and urban renewal, art and real life? This arts workshop will emphasize making site work by completing a progressive series of studies, using various artistic mediums. We will also be reading about and viewing site work by seminal artists in this field. This course is recommended to adventurous students with interests and some training in at least one of the following mediums: dance, theatre, spoken word poetry, media, photography and/or visual art. Readings include texts by Suzanne Lacy; Jan Cohen Cruz; Bertie Ferdman, among others.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1080 \u00ab",

The course is designed for the student who is ready to commit to an in-depth investigation of their body and is ready to make physical and mental changes through quiet focused attention. Each class will be divided between lecture, discussion, and experiential material. Students will keep a journal relating to their experience in and out of class and weekly readings. A final project will reflect personal interest and include class experience and readings.

We will also think about the ways drawing has been taught traditionally, and to consider what associations the medium carries today from this history. The question of what constitutes drawing will be approached through process and concept much more than as defined by medium, and the course focuses on an expanded, experimental approach to drawing. Assignments will often be a response to a wide variety of artistic mediums where there exist resonant  relationships (dance, installation, land art, architecture, sculpture, and performance, among others). Students will work in conventional drawing media (pencil, paper, eraser, ink) but will also explore how other media can expand the idea of what \"drawing\" might mean. Although this is a studio course, there is a rigorous reading/research component as well. Texts are assigned for discussion regularly and students will do individual presentations to the class based on focused research topics.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1406 \u00ab",

Is it possible to create artwork outside of narrative? What is the role of a \u2018narrator\u2019 in the visual arts and how can this role be complicated?

We will follow up with discussions, take a trip to the Met, and conclude the course reexamining modern art in light of the inner journey each of us has taken during the course. Readings include van Gennep's Rites of Passage, Chipp's Theories of Modern Art, R.D. Laing, Federico Garcia Lorca on duende, Victor Turner on liminal, Mircea Eliade, James Elkins on alchemy and art, and Frida Kahlo's journal.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1420 \u00ab",

In response to studying these visions of New York, students create their own art works\u2014sketching in Times Square with the garrulous attitude of Reginald Marsh, drawing a skyscraper in an ecstatic John Marin breath, creating a collage by rifling through bins with Arman and Duchamp. The workshop concludes with a collaborative mural project and a final paper analyzing various strategies of expression whereby modern artists discovered the meaning of Manhattan. Through a process of appropriation, imitation, and parody, students are thus encouraged to re-enact the process of \"discovering Manhattan,\" to engage in a dialogue with the city, and thereby to discover their own artistic voices. Readings include E.B. White's ineffable \"Here is New York,\" Alan Ginsberg's outrageous \"Howl,\" Robert Henri's Art Spirit, as well as excerpts from Natalie Edgar's \"The Club\" which met at the Cedar Tavern on 13th and University, a few blocks from here, then Harold Rosenberg, Irving Sandler, and Federico Garcia Lorca's \"Duende\" from his Poeta en Nueva York lecture.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1425 \u00ab",

With the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519, a new hybrid culture resulted from the fusion of two different worlds, the Iberian and the Native American: a fusion which continues to exist and grow to the present day. This interdisciplinary workshop will closely examine the art, culture and mythology of Mexico, both before and after the conquest, and combines our study of it with hands on art making. The course will begin with a brief overview of the major Mexican muralists, Rivera, Orozco, and Siquieros, and American artists who were influenced by them such as Guston, O'keefe, and Pollock. It will then move chronologically from the Olmec culture occurring 4,000 years ago; Teotihuacan, or the City of the Gods; the Toltecs of Tula, from which emerged Quetzalcoatl the \"Feathered Serpent,\" a figure that inspired art for centuries; the hyper-religious Aztecs; the large and complex Mayan culture; and lastly, the new hybrid art formed by the synthesis of Spanish and Native American cultures. Topics to be covered will include: astrology/astronomy; religion and shamanism; mythology; and human sacrifice. Museum trips, slide shows, videos, and the reading of rare texts such as the Popul Vuh will also be scheduled.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1431 \u00ab",

The course will focus especially on the evolution of both Times Square and Union Square in New York City, to understand how art, commerce, politics, and public life have competed and converged to influence social and political change over the years. But the experiential component of the course is a technology-based public art project (most likely involving large-scale digital media) that students will plan and execute. The project will most likely utilize large-scale digital media, and the instructor will secure the necessary funds to carry it out. Students will keep a journal for the duration of the project, which will be used to evaluate the project and to connect it to other coursework. Readings for the course will be drawn from a number of sources, including: Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space; Rosalyn Deutsche, Evictions: Art and Spatial Politics; Barbara Goldstein, Public Art By The Book; Hayden, Dolores.

Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students will depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved.  Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they will determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color).  Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette will be strongly encouraged. Students will also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points.  Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived.  Classes will offer technical instruction, critiques of student work, debates on street photography, visual analysis and discussions with invited artists, and will be highly collaborative.

Weekly discussions include understanding hardware mechanics, choosing a personal color palette, and recognizing \u201cyour\u201d unique composition key. We will debate the many analog and digital tools available to photographers vital to their artistic expression. These concepts will be supported by weekly assignments and class critiques culminating in a final project portfolio. Students with interest in analog or digital formats will be encouraged to develop an understanding of their medium and form an original visual strategy. Museum/ gallery visits and field trips for on-location photographing will inspire students to create their own way of seeing.

How does our experience and understanding change when our engagement is primarily through our ears? This arts workshop investigates sound as it comes into play in contemporary visual art practice, installation art, experimental music, and various confluences of these. We will study historical examples of early recording technologies, and explore experimental sound works that provide the intellectual and conceptual antecedents for sound art today. We will also think analytically and historically about the concepts of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201csilence.\u201d Students will explore the potential of sound as an artistic medium by creating sound-based works as well as studying the work of other artists (John Cage, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Steven Vitiello, Christina Kubisch, and Susan Philipsz are some contemporary examples). This is not a music or composition class, and the emphasis of this class falls strongly on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development. Although experience editing sound is helpful, it is not required. Production assignments are assigned in tandem with with readings of contemporary and historical writing, critical essays and artist\u2019s statements. There will be a strong emphasis placed on discussion, group critique, and student presentations. Guest speakers are a regular part of the course and include artists, curators/critics, and producers of sound who engage the subject from a variety of viewpoints. Ultimately, students in this course will arrive at an enhanced experience of listening such that their knowledge, awareness, and creative engagement with sound is significantly altered.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1490 \u00ab",

Through a series of exercises, we will discover how environment and experience influence identity, how plot is built on desire and need, and why perception and cultural context dictate the form or structure of a play. By examining classical paradigms and their influence on modern theatre, we can determine how to use or break these rules to find our own voices. And as we mine our souls and surroundings for the seeds of creation, we will write a one-act play. Some readings include Fornes, Fugard, Satre, Korder and Chekov.",

We will consider the history of video art, from William Wegman, Vito Acconci, Gary Hill, and Linda Benglis, to Bill Viola, Eija-Liisa Ahtila, and Walid Raad, among many others. Examining the history of video as an art form will require that we make sense of the interaction between artistic and non-artistic uses of the medium, as well as the ways in which artists do the work of representing important aspects of life in the visual field as such technological innovations as video have transformed that experience. What does video offer as a mode of representation that other mediums do not? Are there things that video does particularly well? Conversely, what are the blind spots of the medium? While all students will write critical papers as well as produce short video projects, students are asked to elect to enroll in one of two course code options; Option 1 (Video as Interdisciplinary Seminar, wherein major work completed is of the written type) or Option 2 (Video as Arts Workshop, wherein major work completed is artwork/ video projects). All students meet together regardless of Option elected, and all students are also required to attend weekly screenings of videos in addition to regular course meeting hours.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1609 \u00ab",

They begin by creating a concept and program. Planning issues, such as function, circulation and spatial organization are discussed, as well as methods for evaluating a project. Designs are developed through perspectives and isometric images made in Sketchup or hand drawings. Films, lectures, and texts on design theory provide additional insights. Drafting experience is useful, but not required.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1621 \u00ab",

In response to these issues, the design professions have created new concepts for green architecture, sustainable cities, alternative infrastructure and products. They've also introduced new laws and environmental standards. This course presents green design and planning concepts through readings, discussions, lectures, films, and projects. Students write a short paper and create three design projects. The papers examine issues such as energy, transportation, recycling, planning, and design. The projects include design of a recycled product, planning of a roof terrace or small green building, and analysis of an urban park or neighborhood. The projects are developed through maps, photographs, computer diagrams, and architectural drawings.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1623 \u00ab",

Through those shows and the newly developed \"gift shops,\" American consumers came to appreciate contemporary design of furniture, cheese slicers, textiles, and \"branded\" storage containers, like Tupperware. But, by focusing on domestic objects and consumption, it can be argued that the opportunity for a larger discourse on the value of good design for towns, cities, and regions was lost. This workshop engages and evaluates the tools and processes that are used to design objects as well as buildings and landscapes. Projects increase in scale throughout the term, as students design a thing they can hold (an object), something that can hold them (clothing, furniture), and a space they might inhabit (a room, a house). As a project-based course, students will work individually and in teams. Digital design experience is helpful but not required.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1626 \u00ab",

The course begins with a history of 19th and 20th century transitions, and then examines current strategies and concepts for the future. Through films, readings, lectures, and projects, students are introduced to the design and planning process. Assignments include such projects as: design of a recycled product; planning analysis of a public site, and design of a small green building.

Activating Art explores the political potential of aesthetic production, offering students a history of the diverse methodologies used to fuse symbolic imaginaries to social and ethical struggles.  The role of the artist in society is critically interrogated and examined in local and global contexts from the late twentieth century through the contemporary period.  Diverse social movements and struggles will be explored in relation to their accompanying aesthetics, theories and tactics of resistance.  Key concepts include cultural agency, social sculpture, participatory dissent, interventionism, and political performance.  In 2012 we will dedicate a special section of the course to the creation of an activist forum for critical \u201cborder-thinking,\u201d what Gloria Anzald\u00faa has called a means of \u201cchanging the way we perceive reality, the way we see ourselves, and the ways we behave,\u201d  using an interdisciplinary framework that amply explores the politics of border-making, border-enforcement, and border-trespassing. Class requirements include comprehensive research projects and may include field trips to relevant sites/exhibitions. Studio assignments encourage individual and group experimentation across diverse media, with projects in creative writing, performance, and new media. Operating as a workshop in praxis, students are asked to critically engage history, theory and research as they brainstorm and attempt to change the world.  Some artists and theorists explored in this class include: Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Donna Haraway, Chela Sandoval, Guillermo G\u00f3mez Pe\u00f1a, Nicholas de Genova, Sandy Stone, Regina Jos\u00e9 Galindo, Dr. Lakra, Arjun Appadurai, Superbarrio Gomez, Rosalinda Fregoso, Cherrie Moraga, Eva Hayward.\n\n      less description for ARTS-UG 1645 \u00ab",

In addition, students in both classes will have the opportunity to commission and edit both written text and art works from one another. Each class will meet two times a week: once with its designated professor, and once as a collaborative lab with both classes and both professors. The lab will be devoted to the conception, development, and production of publications that will each include a 32-page print prototype and new media elements.
