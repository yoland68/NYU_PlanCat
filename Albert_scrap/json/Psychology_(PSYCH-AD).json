The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that  humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human. This course is open to all students but will not count towards the Psychology major.\n\n      less description for PSYCH-AD  100 \u00ab",
