We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.\n\n      less description for MEDI-UA   25 \u00ab",
