Private lessons may be taken in voice, music, dance, acting, and the visual arts, with teachers or studios of their choice\u2014as long as they have met with the approval of the Gallatin faculty.  Credit for private lessons is determined by the number of instruction hours per semester.  Students taking private lessons are required to submit a journal and final assessment paper to the faculty adviser.  Unlike private lessons offered elsewhere in the University, Gallatin's private lessons are arranged and paid for by the student. The student is responsible for full payment to the studio or instructor for the cost of the private lessons, as well as to NYU, for the tuition expenses incurred by the number of private lessons course credits.\n\n      less description for INDIV-GG 2701 \u00ab",

Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instructor; these specifics are described in the Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Dean\u2019s Office for approval.  The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student\u2019s work.  Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course.  Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 credits.  Meeting hours correspond to course credits; a 4-credit independent study requires at least seven contact hours per term between the teacher and the student.\n\n      less description for INDIV-GG 2901 \u00ab",
