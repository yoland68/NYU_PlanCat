These two systems are then integrated into a global picture of the biosphere. Topics include: the carbon cycle, climate feedbacks and anthropogenic influences; global ecology, energy transport, the paleoclimate record, the coupled atmosphereoceanice- land system, and climate modeling. The course addresses local and global issues such as desertification, carbon production by fossil fuels, and green technology as exemplified in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Masdar City, which is attempting to become the world\u2019s first...\n\n      more description for MDENV-AD  110 \u00bb\n\n      \n\n\n\nThis course introduces students to the fundamental dynamics of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and its oceans.

This course emphasizes market solutions to various problems and market limitations in the allocation of environmental resources. Energy issues focus on OPEC and world oil markets; taxation and regulation of production and consumption; conservation of natural resources; and the transition to alternative energy sources.

In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching  the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.\n\n      less description for MDENV-AD  115 \u00ab",
