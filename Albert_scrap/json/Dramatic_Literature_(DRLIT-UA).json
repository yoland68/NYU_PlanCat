And how did its performance onstage differ from its performance offstage during a period that witnessed a rebirth of theatre? In this course we read a number of plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and histioriography. Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell?arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well the ?revisions? that women playwrights and writers make to a largely male-dominated canon.\n\n      less description for DRLIT-UA  720 \u00ab",
