The course looks at the concept of a formal language and covers semantic and proof-theoretic methods of testing arguments for validity. Semantic concepts of tautology, logical equivalence and consistency are compared with their proof-theoretic counterparts, and the notions of soundness and completeness of proof-theoretic methods are introduced. | Prerequisites: None.

Emphasis is on the position of Heidegger, his predecessors, followers and critics. The course will examines Heidegger\u2019s unusual interpretation of East Asian philosophy in relation to technology. Heidegger claimed to find merit in Eastern thought, and his critique of Western technology is seen in an Eastern philosophical context. | Prerequisites: One Level 2 STS Cluster HuSS elective.
