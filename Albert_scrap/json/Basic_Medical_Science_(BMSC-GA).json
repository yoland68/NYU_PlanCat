While our students are provided courses on select subjects, formal instruction on how to do research is not offered. As this can be frustrating and inefficient for the students, Dr. Tung-Tien Sun has organized a course to assist students in learning how to get laboratory techniques to work reproducibly and predictably; read a paper actively rather than passively; select a good project; keep current with the scientific literature and the relevance of such a task; write a scientific paper; become an effective seminar speaker. This course consists of five sessions, each two hours long (one hour lecture plus one hour discussion), covering several topics that a graduate student must master in order to survive and to excel in doing research. The course covers the following topics: experimental design, literature analysis, scientific writing, oral presentation, and computer skills.\n\n      less description for BMSC-GA 1999 \u00ab",

Many faculty, students, and postdocs from NYU and the greater New York area regularly attend these meetings. \nThe NYAS GIDG covers a broad range of topics including the DNA damage response, DNA replication, transcription, chromatin modification, recombination, cell cycle control, telomeres, chromosome segregation, epigenetic states, as well as the emergence of new technologies relevant to research in genome integrity. Prior to each meeting students will be assigned four papers (one for each talk) and then will meet with a participating genome integrity training grant (TG) faculty member each week for the four weeks prior to the meeting to discuss the papers in a journal club format. Eight TG faculty will participate each year hosting one Journal Club during the Fall and one during the Spring semester.
