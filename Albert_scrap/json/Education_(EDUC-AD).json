However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity.  Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course.  We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.\n\n      less description for EDUC-AD  116J \u00ab",
