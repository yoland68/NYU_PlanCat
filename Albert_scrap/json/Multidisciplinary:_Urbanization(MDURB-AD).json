This course examines the ways in which New Yorkers reshaped European modernism and created a distinctive legacy that marks the city to this day. Exploring the reciprocal relationship between modernism and the city, the course investigates how modernism was shaped by urban experience and how, in turn, modernism helped to mold our conception of the modern city.",

How are civic and political institutions addressing emerging problems related to massive population growth, sprawl, pollution, and polarization?

This course explores the variety of complex issues surrounding postcatastrophe reconstruction (PCR) and provides an understanding of the process and players in emergency response situations as well as a critical historical analysis of previous reconstruction efforts. We compare the unique characteristics of various PCR situations, such as natural disaster vs. terrorism, urban vs. rural, developing vs. developed nations; discuss issues surrounding immediate rapid response and long-term reconstruction; and evaluate pre-event preparedness plans and development aimed at lessening the occurrence and effects of emergency events. The class includes a field trip to Sri Lanka where students have an opportunity to experience first-hand and gain an understanding of the realities on the ground in a post-catastrophe area. In addition, students have the opportunity to meet with NGOs and government officials involved in the humanitarian as well as reconstruction effort. This course will include a field trip to Sri Lanka.\n\n      less description for MDURB-AD  117J \u00ab",

The rise of mega-cities has captured much attention, however most of the world\u2019s urban growth will take place in small to mid-size cities. To some extent, this is a desirable trend as smaller urban environments and utopian models of urban development. This course is a comparative study of the evolution of 19th and 20th century urban infrastructure. It examines the designs of complex infrastructure networks for moving people, goods, water, waste, energy, and information: from pipelines to the telecommunication network, from sidewalks to freeways and ports, and from personal carriers to mass transit.  In this course students develop a perspective on how the growth of urban population in first half of 19th century led to innovations in the second half of the century that sustained the tremendous growth of 19th century urban population; and how this trend continued to support that growth in the 20th century urban population. Each student will select a city and research the evolution of the various layers of that city\u2019s infrastructure. The student \u201cCities Project\u201d will be presented in the form of maps, photos, videos, interviews, stories.\n\n      less description for MDURB-AD  120 \u00ab",
