The corrective is an expressly 21st century mode of ecological seeing and questioning that allows us to reconceive of ourselves and the world as beyond nature. But because the idea of nature remains so central to our understanding of ethics, law, human sexuality, psychology and personhood, and artistic representation, we must ask what implications the new ecology might have for our understanding of these features of culture. In this course we survey the positions of the new ecology, and then apply these methods of critique to examples of society, self, and art (throughout intellectual history up to the present). This application will both reveal how central nature is to our ideological understanding of culture and deconstruct our notion of the natural world.  This course will extend writing skills and concepts learned in GPS Writing Workshop, focusing on critical theory, research, and academic writing and expression in the humanities.  The primary assignments will be analytical essays and a digital expressions project.\n\n      less description for CCCF-SHU  101W1 \u00ab",

In this Perspectives on Humanities course, we will explore the historical evolution--especially in the Western tradition-- of the hero both as a person of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities, and as the central protagonist in a work of literature around whom the plot generally revolves. We will examine a great variety of literary heroes as they relate to their fictional worlds and to the literary genres they inhabit: the epic hero, the tragic hero, the Shakespearean hero, the female hero, the comic hero, the antihero, etc. In reading and discussing these primary sources, we also will discuss different critical approaches to the study of literature from traditional historical philology, comparative mythology, and psychoanalysis, to structuralism, formalism, and genre studies.  This course will extend writing skills and concepts learned in GPS Writing Workshop, focusing on critical theory, research, and academic writing and expression in the humanities.

Gender figures significantly in the relational dynamics among the above players--voluntarily, consciously or not\u2014profoundly impacting the individual and groups. While our main objective is to gain a deeper, more complex understanding of the sometimes subtle yet potent play of power involved in the dynamics of gender relations, our examination of texts will also bring us close to other fundamental human issues, such as those relating to the \u201cshadow\u201d of the beast in human nature, the quest for knowledge (if not always wisdom), the uncertainties of identity and self, the creative need for love and community, the compulsive fear of/attraction to death, the longing for transformation and transcendence, among others. The course will draw on a range of literary texts (epic, novel, drama, etc.), products of visual culture, and forms of the expressive/performance arts to explore how each has chosen to articulate, animate and resolve the above human relationships. To gain perspective, we will apply a variety of critical lenses in our close readings of texts, including psychological and philosophical theorists such as Freud, Irigaray, Foucault and others.  This course will extend writing skills and concepts learned in GPS Writing Workshop, focusing on critical theory, research, and academic writing and expression in the humanities.
