It saw the explosion of the nation's major cities (especially London) and the entrenchment of Britain as a colonial power in Canada, India, and elsewhere (as well as the loss of the American colonies in 1776). The age of Enlightenment saw new scientific theories and discoveries, extensive overseas exploration, and almost ceaseless challenges to diverse forms of authority (political, religious, cultural, and so on). It saw the development of the literary marketplace and Grub Street and the rise of new genres that are still popular today (the novel and journalism, for instance), as well as the emergence of professional women writers and the rise of proto-feminist writing. We will explore genres such as fiction, drama, poetry, satire, essays, travel writing, and biography, and authors such as Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, Thomas Gray, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Ann Radcliffe, Francis Burney, and Jane Austen.\n\n      less description for ENGL-UA  501 \u00ab",

Book History addresses more than just books: it investigates the production, dissemination, and readership of all kinds of textual materials, from papyrus to e-books.  This course, aimed at those who want a broad, introductory overview to the field, offers a sweeping survey of key issues and historical moments and transformations from oral culture to manuscript to print to hypertext. Specific topics will vary from semester to semester, but what unites all book historians is the conviction that the material format of text itself matters.  Hands-on workshops and field trips will allow all students to learn how to \"read\" and describe books, manuscripts, or other texts as meaningful artifacts in themselves (rather than as transparent vehicles of meaning).  Other typical topics include major format changes and technological transitions in book production (e.g. the printing revolution) and their cultural impact, the history of censorship, copyright, and intellectual property, newspapers and periodicals, ephemera, Grub Street and the history of authorship, and the ways that digital texts, resources, and media, and computational tools and methods are currently transforming research in the humanities.\n\n      less description for ENGL-UA  732 \u00ab",
