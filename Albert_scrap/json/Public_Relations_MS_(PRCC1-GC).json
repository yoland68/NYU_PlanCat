Guest journalists will discuss their amenability to various story 'pitches,' and address issues such as: Is it more important for the 'pitch' to be interesting or informative?  In addition, does the media have a penchant for bad news?  Successful media relations practitioners will weigh in on those questions, as well as others, such as: Why are so many spokespeople afraid of the press? And, when does the press not have a right to know?  The pedagogical approach will be hands - on, including many writing assignments and role - playing interviews, both under deadline pressures.  A formula for successful media relations will emerge, with preparation as the constant.  Students will also study materiality and disclosure requirements, and crisis management and ethics, in the various contexts of the print, network, cable and Internet media.\n\n      less description for PRCC1-GC 1040 \u00ab",

On the management side, the course will explore questions such as these: How can audiences be segmented and targeted most efficiently? What communication databases can be helpful?  How to maximize the use of scarce budget dollars?  And, when is it prudent to develop internal capabilities versus retaining outside (agency) help? On the leadership side, these and other challenges will be explored: How to find and develop good communicators? How to find and develop diversity in candidates? How to test for writing ability? How to build a continuing education or in - house training program? How to manage weak performers?  And, how to work with internal and external colleagues?  The course examines the issues from the agency, corporate and not - for - profit perspectives. This course will also stress the skills necessary for communicators to have a `seat at the leadership table,? the lack of which is a frequent lament of practitioners. The skills include mastering the art of giving advice and building trust; gaining a basic knowledge of the major parts of an organization, such as finance; and gaining a `world view? of the issues that most directly impact particular industries or organizations. The semester - long simulation tests the student?s ability to lead and manage a public relations department, addressing such critical issues as organizational structure, budgets, mission and vision.\n\n      less description for PRCC1-GC 1050 \u00ab",

Students will learn how to approach one of the most difficult tasks facing corporate communicators today: how to pull together all the internal and external communications initiatives, from press releases to advertising, that impact various constituencies in terms of their awareness, attitudes and behavior.  Specifically, an organization?s product positioning should be consistent with the overall positioning of the organization itself, and both communications initiatives should flow from the core principles the organization stands for (for example, a commitment to the marketing of quality products).  So, if those core principles are not sound, and if they are not communicated consistently to internal and external audiences, performance and reputation will suffer, as the spate of recent scandals demonstrated.  While a good reputation cannot be built, or at least sustained, unless the organization does good things, reputation is a function of communication as well as behavior ? so both have to be managed consistently and well. Governance and disclosure principles are overviewed.\n\n      less description for PRCC1-GC 1060 \u00ab",

Students will also be introduced to methods for correctly citing references and quoting other works without plagiarizing, infringing upon copyright or violating the rules governing proprietary information.

The course reviews the research skills that inform advocacy and lobbying. Establishing goals, developing advocacy plans, and implementing actions will be discussed in the context of building long standing, trusting relationships. Within the United States, the course will survey the laws and techniques for advocacy within for - profit and not - for - profit organizations including direct lobbying, grassroots lobbying, political action, and policy advertising.

In other words, organizations are, or at least should be, concerned with issues of intrinsic identity (what they stand for) and reputation (how they are perceived). This course examines how to manage identity and reputation as assets so that, over the long term, they will contribute to the growth and viability of the organization, as significantly as any asset might. The course also examines how identity influences the ways in which organizations represent themselves to the various constituencies, and how identity is influenced by interactions with the groups. While a good reputation cannot be built, or at least sustained, unless the organization does good things, reputation is a function of communication as well as performance and behavior\u2014so all three have to be managed consistently and well. In combining theoretical foundations with a case-study approach, students will be encouraged to examine issues of identity, representation and reputation critically and analytically. The case study approach will include organizations with the best and worst reputations. Among the organizational reputation cases examined in class will be: the Apple iPhone 4 problem; BP oil spill in the gulf, Pepsi syringe hoax; Firestone-Explorer tire crisis; Prudential insurance fraud; General Motors Dateline NBC Truck Explosion controversy; and the Toyota recall. We will examine organizations with exceptionally strong intrinsic identities including Starbucks and the Mayo Clinic. Cases will include several European and Asian firms.\n\n      less description for PRCC1-GC 2160 \u00ab",
