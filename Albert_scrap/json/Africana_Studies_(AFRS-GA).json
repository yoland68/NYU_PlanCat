Because reproduction connects the intimate experiences of individuals to larger historical structures and forces and because reproduction is such a fundamental (if varied) biological and social experience, this topic in particular lends itself to comparative work. This course explores issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on American and African contexts. This cross-cultural breadth helps students to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and sociocultural context. Through readings, students consider how different disciplinaryorientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) approach women?s history both methodologically, theoretically, and in terms of narrative and analytic strategies.\n\n      less description for AFRS-GA 2600 \u00ab",

Little if any attention goes to the huge though uncounted black Latino population, the group that fLatinos are now called ?the nation?s largest minority,? outpacing African Americans and thereby signaling a benchmark in the changing meaning of what it means to be American. In public accounts of this dramatic shift, Latinos are commonly counterposed against African Americans in mutually exclusionary terms: either you are Hispanic or you are black. Little if any attention goes to the huge though uncounted black Latino population, the group that fits neatly in neither the Hispanic nor the black category and yet may play a decisive role in the emerging cultural configurations and political alignments of our times. This course examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theorizing on race and diasporas. After an overview of the historical background of African-descendant peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas, the course then traces the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Along with a discussion of migration patterns and community formations, there is a focus on narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and on the traditions of cultural expression; special attention goes to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations, from rumba, mambo, and Cubop to salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally, the course turns to the possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self-conscious transnational identity formation.\n\n      less description for AFRS-GA 2802 \u00ab",
