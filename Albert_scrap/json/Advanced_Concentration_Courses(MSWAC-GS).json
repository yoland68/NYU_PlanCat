This is part of the fight for broader social justice that is among your obligations under the NASW\u2019s Code of Ethics. We will examine and evaluate strategies for effective policy change at the federal, state, city, neighborhood, and agency level through a careful examination of the relevant academic literature and the history of struggles for change. But this is an applied course, too, during which you will undertake your own semester-long project in policy advocacy on an issue of your choice, learning about how to make change by trying to do it. By the end of the semester, you should have new scholarly and practical knowledge about how to make the world a little more fair and a little more just.\n\n      less description for MSWAC-GS 2027 \u00ab",
