This process of deconstructing performance through the Viewpoints opens the possibility of moving among and through many levels of reality and establishing a mobility of inner life.  This laboratory will consist of five elements: physical training, Viewpoints practices and improvisation, scene study and improvisation, and performance collaboratively produced by students and faculty to demonstrate the results of this personal and collective research in a semester-end public showing.  The laboratory provides a technical foundation in contact improvisation, experiential anatomy, developmental movement, and improvisatory-based release techniques as it applies to both actors and directors.  Students are guided through improvisational studies to experientially locate and creatively define these elements as ensemble languages and internal technique.  Group and solo improvisations are used as a basis for composition and later integrated into scene work.  In scene study, the Viewpoints are used to establish the fundamental presence of the actor, which is expanded to include character, text, and the audience.\n\n      less description for THEA-UT  357 \u00ab",

SSAW is conducted at Stonestreet's 6,000 sq. ft. film, television and internet studio, where professional directors, producers, and casting directors develop and produce movies, pilots, commercials, television and webseries. Students train and work in the same environment with access to full production and post-production facilities (including several editing systems and editors) with the guidance of constructive teachers who are industry professionals. The emphasis of the workshop is on becoming imaginative and creative actors who are both believable and interesting cinematically in any genre while embracing a wide variety of characters and material from different periods and cultures. While screen acting can utilize many of the same techniques and tools of theater acting, there are significant differences with regard to subtext, how the current technology can be used in creative and non-limiting ways, as well as with creating organic and compelling characters that often appear in a medium or long shot but also under the magnifying glass of the close-up. Ultimately students are guided from audition to rehearsal to performance with the hopes of inspiring with ideas and stories that are meaningful to both the actor and the audience. Workshop classes include: Screen Acting & Character, Muliti-Camera Screen Acting, Sit-coms, Improv & Comedy on Film, Commercials & the Business, the History of Screen Acting, Voice-overs and Voice on Screen, and Introduction to Audition & Performance.

Whether or not these institutions are revered or  criticized by art, they are often the foundational structures that shape an American's private and public experiences, one's work life (\"employment\"), and domestic life (\"marriage,\" \"family\"). Certainly, the nation's super-structures influence each one's lives, directly or indirectly-such as government (federal, state, local), military, the church, education, and entertainment. This course analyzes institutional structures and their impact on the diverse theatrical representations of individualization and community produced in and by a democratic society. We will look at conventional and experimental theatre--from canonized to under-represented work-created by a wide range of artists. Among the playwrights under consideration: Glaspell, Crothers, O'Neill, Stein, Treadwell, Odets, Saroyan, Wilder, Williams, Miller, Wright/Green, Albee, Kennedy, Fornes, Mamet, Pinero, Shanley, Houston, Parks, Wilson, Kushner, Cruz, Smith, Hoch, Jones, Forbes, Power, Beaty, The Group Theatre, Open Theatre, Wooster Group, Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Split Britches, Five Lesbian Brothers, Universes, and  Elevator Repair Service. Among the critics: Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche, DuBois, Fanon, Althuser, Foucault, Butler, Savran, Diamond, Delbanco, Roediger, and Elam. Our semester's question: To what extent does US drama and performance reinscribe institutional \"policy\"/conventions or radically intervene in an effort to overturn familiar paradigms in favor of new representations and theatricalities?

From the 1920\u2019s agitation trials (Agitsud), mass spectacles, and agitprop theater during the Russian Revolution to contemporary theatrical responses to disease, war, racism, and social oppression the course will examine how theater has been used as a reaction to social and political unrest, as a tool to fight oppression (or a tool to encourage obedience and propagate national political ideals), and as a respite from hardship.  We will look at the performance theories  and strategies that emerged during these theatrical moments, and we will read seminal plays that were written and staged during these periods.  Throughout the course we will ask the question, \u201cWhy is theater often used as a response to crisis?\u201d In addition to the historical and theoretical work the course will have a practical component.  Students will be asked to imagine how he or she would produce a theatrical response to either a contemporary crisis (i.e. the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, marriage equality, abortion rights, health care reform\u2026etc) or a historical crisis (i.e. Civil Rights, Vietnam War, sexual liberation, Women\u2019s Rights\u2026etc..).

We will look at the relationship of Realism and Naturalism to the philosophical climate of the 1800s (Hegel, Darwin, Marx, Freud), to other theatrical movements (Romanticism, Symbolism, Expressionism and Aestheticism), to contemporaneous dramatic and literary forms (melodrama, the well-made play, the novel, photography), and to concrete historical trends (the rise of nation states, changing sex roles and family structures). The course focuses on the plays of the major European dramatists who defined the movement (Zola, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Shaw), and tentatively traces its transformation in early to middle 20th century American drama. The inevitable question as to whether \"the real\" and \"the natural\" can ever be truly represented will be faced, but not at the expense of failing to ask what may or may not be gained from the attempt.

The idea that truth can be attained more fully outside the realm of realism and traditional narrative has been the take-off point for Expressionism, Theatre of Cruelty, Surrealism, The Epic Theatre, Theatre of the Absurd, and Postmodernism. Plays and performances from each of these movements will be investigated for their innovation and examined within their historical context. Texts will include both representative plays and relevant essays by the playwrights (including Strindberg, Wedekind, Kandinsky, Kaiser, O'Neill, Treadwell, Artaud, Brecht, Beckett, Ionesco and Shepard, among others) as well as their literary and intellectual contemporaries. Over the course of the semester, each student will do in-depth research on a thematic area culminating in a group presentation and a final research paper.

Taking note of simultaneous developments in visual art, dance, music, and cinema to reflect their impact on and by theatre, we will also place artistic innovation within a broader sociopolitical and cultural context, including the Industrial Revolution, shifts in political and psychological ideologies, and the long-term effects of globalization on artistic production and reception. Throughout our study, we will ask ourselves: What comprises the \u201cavant-garde\u201d and does it still exist?; What is our relation, as students, performers, writers, and directors, to the historical avant-garde?; and How do the works of the historical avant-garde affect our engagement with contemporary theatre and performance today?
