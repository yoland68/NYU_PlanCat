For those with little knowledge of Chinese poetry, this class will serve as an introduction by way of English translations; for those with a strong knowledge of the original Chinese classics, the class will re-present poets from Li Bai and Du Fu to Bei Dao and Gu Cheng as they have variously appeared globally to Anglophone readers the world over. All students will deepen their engagements not only with poetry and challenges of Chinese-English literary translation, but also with compelling questions arising from the philosophy of language, translation theory and literary criticism that ask us to radically reconsider how culture is represented, transmitted, and transformed by the act translation.

Traditionally this genre has been associated with Latin American literature and writers, most famously Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jorge Luis Borges. Yet, the global spread of this genre indicates that it is not exclusively the creative voice of a post-colonial mind, seeking to reconcile its new present with the traditions (and often superstitions) of a colonial and pre-colonial past. Today, the political criteria for inclusion in the genre is as subject to question, as are the very terms post-colonial and post-modern and their allocation. As the magic realist novel is taken up by author\u2019s whose cultural history would seem to exclude them from this category, it has revealed its import in the critical landscape as a form with a \u201ccapacity to link many different literatures\u201d (206).\nIn this class we will be reading several magic realist novels and short stories from authors born in different countries, including Columbia, India, and the USA as we build up to a consideration of the genre as found in modern Chinese literature. We will examine how each of these authors uses the magic realist voice to speak to his or her cultural history, national future and personal sense of identity. Since classes will involve analyzing the texts from a variety of theoretical stances, and discussing our responses to their ideas and content, students should be prepared to keep up with the reading and contribute in class. \nWorks Cited:\nDe La Campa, Roman. \u201cMagic Realism and World Literature: A Genre for the Times?\u201d Revista Canadiense di Estudios Hispanicos.  23:2 (Invierno 1999): 205-19.\n(satisfies Core Curriculum: China Arts)\n\n      less description for LIT-SHU  223 \u00ab",
