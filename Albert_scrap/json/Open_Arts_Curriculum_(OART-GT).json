On the far edge of this movement, however, there are writers, photographers and filmmakers whose work calls attention to the traditional documentary ethics of bearing witness but whose modes of representation blur the lines between fact and fiction. This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings, which also include more personal themes such as loss and melancholy, the ephemeral nature of time and memory, nostalgia and change.\n \nWe will study several different kinds of visual poetics such as combining documentary photos with literature, artists working with archives and found images, the personal essay film, ethnographic poetics, photo reportage and new media visual storytelling, mixed media and public projections. Some of the writers and artists we will study include Alfredo Jaar, W.G. Sebald, Chris Marker, Christian Boltanski, Forough Farrokhzad, Susan Sontag, Marcelo Brodsky, Roland Barthes, Miguel Rio Branco, Alexander Sokurov, Lorna Simpson, Jean Rouch, Susan Meiselas, Jonas Mekas.\n\n      less description for OART-GT 2829 \u00ab",

We will study the impact of Cuban cultural policy dictated by Fidel Castro in 1961 and in 1970 through documents of the period, which determined the course of Cuban\narts for decades. We will continue with a survey of the visual arts on the island and consider how they constituted highly sophisticated interpretations of the always changing reality, whether in painting of the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s or installation practice of the 1990\u2019s. Classic documentaries and films by prestigious Cuban filmmakers (Santiago Alvarez and Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea) will be reviewed and analyzed, and we will conclude with an analysis of the most recent artistic expressions: Cuban hip-hop music and the edgy video works of Ernesto Oroza, Henry Eric Hern\u00e1ndez, and other young artists. In this most recent work, political criticism, Cuban history and deconstructive techniques collide, reflecting the multiple layers of Cuban culture and its continuing development today. The course will include visits to the Center of Cuban Studies and to The 8th Floor Gallery in New York to discuss Cuban artworks in view.\n\n      less description for OART-GT 2832 \u00ab",
