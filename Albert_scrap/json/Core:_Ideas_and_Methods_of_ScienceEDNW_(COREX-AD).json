Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems  and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project.  The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities.

To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.\n\n      less description for COREX-AD   15 \u00ab",

You will learn the basics of linguistics and then will interact with a cross-cultural database and analysis platform called Terraling. We will also study data sets that may be useful for cross-cultural analysis mostly from the social sciences, anthropology, and archaeology.  After that, you will engage in projects to use Terraling to enter other properties and values about a topic of your choice (e.g. about food, legal structure etc.). Some of that data will come from the data sets others have gathered that are on the web and some will come from data that you yourselves gather.

Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome.\n\n      less description for COREX-AD   54 \u00ab",

The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn't until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer's eyes. In this class, we will explore the development of our understanding of the Universe through the historical development of observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today's most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.\n\n      less description for COREX-AD   60 \u00ab",
