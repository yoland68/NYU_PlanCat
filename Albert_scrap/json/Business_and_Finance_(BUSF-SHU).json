The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M & A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.\nClass will be conducted in Chinese.\n\n      less description for BUSF-SHU  188 \u00ab",
