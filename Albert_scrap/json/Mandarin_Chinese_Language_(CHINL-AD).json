This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II  and take Intermediate Chinese I directly. \n\nThe course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned;  understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.\n\n      less description for CHINL-AD  103 \u00ab",
