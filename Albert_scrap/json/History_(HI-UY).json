Emphasis will be given more to the conquest of Americas in Caribbean, Mexico, Peru, Central America, New Mexico and Brazil. In doing so, this course will address the role of the Catholic Church, the imposed imperial system and the sufferings of indigenous people.\nFor many historians, 1492 is the landmark of European-dominated modernity. While the Chinese made a major breakthrough in navigation and while the Arab merchants traded globally, the Europeans were far behind in modernity. But by 1492 Europeans expanded its horizons to the Americas, Asia and Africa. Was it because of gold? Was it because of religious motivation? Or was it to save the \u201csavages\u201d? What consequences did the indigenous population face? What advancement did the Europeans make in such ventures? This course will address these questions. | Prerequisites: Completion of first year writing requirements. Co-requisites: None.
