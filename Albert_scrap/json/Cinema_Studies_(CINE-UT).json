Specific topics include horror in relation to historical trauma, J-Horror Movement, representation of violence, ghostly sexualities, vampirism, transcultural encounters, horror genre hybridizations (through melodrama, detective thriller, martial arts, comedy, musical), as well as the politics of transnational remakes. Special attention also goes to such international auteurs as Kurosawa Kiyoshi, Miiki Takashi, Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho, Tsui Hark, Ann Hui, and Oxide and Danny Pang. It is not necessary for students to have prior knowledge of Asian cinema, and all are welcome.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  114 \u00ab",

Rather than attempting to rein in film noir, the course celebrates Neo Noir\u2019s exponential extrapolations. Students are encouraged to pursue their cinephilic aptitude in outside screenings.

The course will also engage with the dynamics of the thriving South Asian diaspora that creates successful markets outside of India and stimulates transnational processes of production and distribution of Hindi films. Some of the films that will be screened are Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Lage Raho Munna Bhai, 3 Idiots, Dhoom 2, Dabangg and Ek Tha Tiger.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  154 \u00ab",

Yet one might justifiably ask: if the generic conventions of teenpic are so unstable, how can we define it as a genre at all? This course addresses this question by charting the transformation of the teenpic over time, from the J.D. films of the 1950s to the teen comedies of today.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  162 \u00ab",

Why is \u201cthe misogynist dinosaur from the Cold War\u201d still so popular with female audiences today? How do we explain the success of the offensively orientalist You Only Live Twice in Japan? Why do queer audiences often favor Roger Moore\u2019s raised eyebrow over Daniel Craig\u2019s blue speedo? Chronicling the evolution of 007 over half a century of political, social, and cultural permutations, this summer course will examine the historical and theoretical dimensions and discrepancies of the James Bond phenomenon to understand its seemingly perpetual allure.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  247 \u00ab",

Finally, in contrast to the gourmet treatment of violence in much of Hong Kong\u2019s popular cinema, the stylish nostalgia films of Stanley Kwan and Wong Kar-wai provide further insights into the identity politics of a regional, yet global cinema in a rapidly changing world.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  321 \u00ab",

How much or how little can the moving image move? How does the camera cope with its dynamic subject? Between the body and the camera what type of dialogue is established? From mechanical to corporeal motion, we will examine the technologies and aesthetics of experimental and commercial work, from short films, though Hollywood to music videos. Films such as Playtime, An American in Paris, Beau Travail, Pina, Kung Fu Hustle, Saturday Night Fever and Step Up 3D will be screened alongside videos such as Beyonce's Single Ladies, Gangnam Style and the many, many Harlem Shakes.\n\n      less description for CINE-UT  328 \u00ab",
