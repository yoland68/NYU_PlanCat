What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.\n\n      less description for HUMN-SHU  240 \u00ab",

Setting focus on how ethnicity (minzu) and race (zhongzu) emerge as a historically grounded and changing public discourse, we engage in a comparative examination of multiculturalism as an incomplete ideal. Within and across each of these multiethnic, or multiracial, societies where Han Chinese constitute the majority, we ask how nation-building processes bear on the transformation of minority culture, and vice versa. Toward the end of the course, we also probe the growing impact of domestic and transnational labor migration on the so-called ethnic mosaic. Our goal is not only to understand diversity as a social reality; in asking how such a reality finds voice in various artistic forms including short story, novel, documentary and fiction film, we also train students to do the rigorous work of literary and cultural criticism.\n\n      less description for HUMN-SHU  267 \u00ab",
