How have artists understood the city itself as material, content, creative convergence? While we will look at artistic projects from various global urban contexts, New York City will serve as a primary ongoing site for reference, investigation and engagement. New York will be explored through the work of essayists and fiction writers who have taken the city as subject. We will also direct and make regular excursions into the surrounding urbanscape to shape our creative practices. Students will engage in weekly readings and discussions, complete writing assignments to hone conceptual skills, and create and evaluate their own original artworks both individually and in groups.\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1000 \u00ab",

The course will examine the praxis of collaboration and its content as process and outcome in an international frame of reference. How do we grow and sustain collaborative teamwork in the art context between countries? Students will be asked to create and acknowledge their collaborative agency producing performances, creative platforms, installations, archives, maps, etc  involving their peers, communities, international networks, other artivists or scientists. There is going to be an allocated pool of artists and artivists as correspondents in various countries in Europe to correlate with.  Why is working together with  - a different language, country, cultural framework-  the way in order to share and develop a vision? How is a shared interest presented in a multi-authored project? What can synergy offer to a dynamic dialogue within a framework of trust and sharing? When does collaboration create a synthesis of different perspectives? This course will challenge the notions of hierarchy through systematic roles of participatory interdependence and integrative exchange. The partnerships will evolve through fully documented stages which include: setting the project, its direction and the means of implementation. Communication is a key notion in valuing diversity and thus the focus will be equally - apart from the project itself \u2013on the interpersonal relationships built around it as well. The developmental process of collaboration will dissect the steps of framing the project, planning, setting goals, and coordinate openly in joint practices and collective consensus. The questions do what, for what, so what will be present so the peer\u2019s and instructor\u2019s feedback will illuminate actions and resources.\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1006 \u00ab",

How do artists organize themselves or others to devise alternative approaches to getting art into the world? How do artists negotiate their esthetic vision and political commitments? What makes engaged work sustainable?\n\nThese are some of the questions that we will pursue in this course as we examine a range of conceptual issues and practical examples across cultural, historical and global settings.  We will sketch out the broad social and political forces that impact the arts and also explore the ways in which art engenders a particular approach to and sense of politics and how new possibilities can be imagined. This course aims to provide students with a broad conceptual framework for assessing the relations between art and politics and to be able to situate their own work and aspirations in this context. Students will hone their ability to critique what is; to imagine what could be; and to devise a project by which art that matters and makes a difference might find its way into the world. Each week specific examples of artistic practices will be shown in class so as to develop the critical faculties to read the work for its political resonances and implications.\nThis course will count toward general education requirements for TSOA students (Social Science).\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1010 \u00ab",

With the help of the required texts we will examine socially accepted notions of the \"other\" and see how they are derived and or challenged in and by films, thus looking at how an art form can interact with socially accepted forms of \"othering.\" The objective of the course is to train emerging artists and scholars to engage in critical analysis that can make profound contributions to the individual's unique creative or analytical process.

We will look deeper into varying aspects of staging such as everyday experience, lists, menus, rituals, timing, gathering and collecting.  Performing and communicating the body: gender, race and identification.  Awareness of work in progress, process, such as text, script, online and improvisation will be utilized. The visual aspect of performing:  such as accessories, design and costume. Listening, finding voice and giving and taking commands, and deviation from dominant norms of entertainment and product.  Hopefully with deeper understanding, we will seek to challenge and stimulate our own creative content to produce original, thought provoking performance.  Students will present their own work either individually or in groups, write about the theory and content of their production and have assigned readings to supplement their areas of concentration.\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1028 \u00ab",

Students will be introduced to both recent and historically significant comics about war. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between image and text in sequential art, the fundamentals of graphic novel development, and the ability to critically analyze graphic novels that deal with challenging subject matter. What are the ethical and methodological issues that arise when constructing sequential narratives of war? Are there differences between war narratives that are autobiographical, documentary or fictional? Is there something unique about the format of graphic novels that enables artists to tell a different kind of war story than filmmakers, musicians or performers? How do comic books circulate culturally, and how might this expand or limit their ability to inform our understandings of war? We will explore these questions through close readings, robust discussions and careful written analysis of well-known works by Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi and Joe Sacco, as well as graphic novels by Keiji Nakazawa, Mira Kirshner, Jason Lutes, J.P Stassen, Gipi, Emmanuel Guibert and others.\n\nStudents must be of Sophomore class standing and above.

The first section of the course will take place in advocacy cultural arts community based organizations in the city. Community arts leaders in the field in collaboration with the class instructor will teach the course.  This team teaching approach will afford students direct exposure and learning experiences with practitioners in the field within the communities they serve. In the second section of the course students will develop a project in collaboration with staff of one of the participating institutions. Students will have direct immersion within the community and the community organization understanding the operational and programmatic realities of the field as well as direct engagement in advocacy creative work. Students will be exposed to teaching strategies for working within communities that include readings, open discussions, as well as working on multidisciplinary collaborations in the field.\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1060 \u00ab",

For example, what does it\nmean for a Chinese artist to live and work in France while maintaining their Chinese roots and sensibilities? We will examine intercultural perspectives and representations as they bear upon global and international for artistic work. We will also consider the meanings of global spectatorship in light of technological forms and mediations of particular cultural experiences. How do meanings change across these contexts and who decides or judges what is considered to be of greatest value? What role do international art markets play in how artists pursue their own creative process and professional opportunities? What kinds of art are considered suitable for international audiences, what are the political and cultural expectations for these forms? We will consider the ways in which such economic, cultural and esthetic questions figure in the shaping and articulation of cultural policy. How do the kinds of media and information that artists have access to shape the way in which they craft their own artistic responses and pursuits.\n\n      less description for ASPP-UT 1067 \u00ab",
