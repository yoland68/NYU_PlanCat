Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by \u201cmutations\u201d, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA.

Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their three-dimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to  macromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.

We examine the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. This information provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments.

This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core\ncomponent of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several\nNYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.\n\n      less description for CCEX-SHU  116 \u00ab",

We will consider the practical outlook associated with the wide range of Chinese technologies and their relationship to the emergence of scientific thinking.  The influence of Western scientific attitudes and accomplishments, especially as mediated through the Jesuit and Protestant missions to China, will be studied.  A question guiding the course will be that of why the world\u2019s most advanced technological civilization in the pre-modern era failed to experience a scientific revolution. Were the premises of Chinese cosmology and philosophy resistant to the development of science? Were Chinese approaches to astronomy and mathematics, and the understanding of the phenomenon of life as represented in classics of Chinese traditional medicine, adverse to scientific methods? \n\nOne lecture and laboratory each week.
