Given unprecedented developments in global demographics, climate change, pollution and questionable resource use patterns, there is a compelling need to rethink some of the basic principles and traditional management practices in business and other organizations.\nAfter addressing the available data on these environmental challenges, students will proceed to examine the basic tenets of orthodox management approaches and practices and their impact on society, including assumptions underlying management decisions, resource use, and production. The course will explore alternative approaches to control or eliminate the deficiencies of current management practices in solving environmental problems. Specific topics to be addressed in the course include traditional principles of management, emerging principles of sustainable management, best practices in sustainability, new policies, institutions and markets created to support the concept and practice of sustainability, among others.
