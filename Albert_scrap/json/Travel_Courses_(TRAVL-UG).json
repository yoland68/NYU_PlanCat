Islands are places where we can see into Earth's interior, into the depths of the ocean, and into the distant past. They have also been key locations for understanding human societies and building empires in the formerly unreachable.  Hawai'i has a number of unusual natural and cultural features that make it a particularly fruitful location for this kind of pursuit. Its marine animals, such as dolphins, can help us understand not only the aquatic environment but also the nature of consciousness and communication. Its indigenous culture still retains a robust presence, providing a way to study how cultures develop in isolation and how they change with outside exposure.  This interdisciplinary science course will explore the Hawaiian islands through the perspective of various scientific disciplines such as geology, oceanography, marine biology, geography, ecology, and astronomy, as well as anthropology, evolution, exploration, and climate change.\n\n      less description for TRAVL-UG 9050 \u00ab",

Often it is said that this novel is 'about the law;' the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is a central driver of Dickens' sprawling story.  Dickens also takes us into the broader world of legal London, offering some of the most memorable lawyer characters in nineteenth-century fiction.  In this course, we focus intently on a slow and careful reading of Bleak House, supplemented by readings and field trips designed to help us understand nineteenth-century London and the Victorians. While locating the course in London will still not let us experience at first-hand Dickens' world, we can bring what might seem like very distant and strange locations closer through outside-the-classroom experiences that permit us to reflect on the city, which is in effect a character in the novel. We will frame our investigation with the idea of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction refers to the expertise or command of a particular court, but we will broaden this idea--as Dickens does in his novel--to think about space, place, and time, affect and desire, and the \" jurisdiction\" of literature. Who gets to \"say the law\" where and with what authority? What is the space of the literary? And how does the space of nineteenth-century London shape Dickens' fiction?\n\n      less description for TRAVL-UG 9125 \u00ab",

Steeped in a legacy of theater performance rooted in the visual tradition, Prague is home and host to some of the most innovative work in theatrical design and performance. This course will trace the genealogy of design influenced performance from its roots in the concentration camps of World War II where the practice of using found objects in imaginative ways began as a means for creating the world of the play to the later 20th century when theater artists invented new ways of communicating visually with their audiences as a means to escape censorship from totalitarian government officials. Through architectural and gallery tours as well as attendance at Czech theaters we will investigate the historical and political conditions from which Eastern European theater emerged in the 20th century and the influence of visual design in contemporary Czech theater.  Every four years, the city is also home to the Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space, the largest exhibition of stage design in the world, showcasing the work of artists from more than 75 countries and featuring performances based in visual elements. The course will coincide with PQ12 and make use of this learning resource and opportunity to interact with artists from all over the world.  The course will include hands on workshops where we will explore tools and approaches for collaboration between the visual and performing arts as well as new ways of incorporating visual arts into storytelling and performance.  Classes, taught in English, meet four days per week.\n\n      less description for TRAVL-UG 9250 \u00ab",

Less noted is the degree to which the African American presence in Paris influenced international art and political thought, from the use of African cubism among European artists to the shaping of the philosophies of thinkers like Sarte, Camus and de Beauvoir.  We will focus on Paris as a site of exchange\u2014as an intersection through which pass influential ideas, forms and actions. We will consider the degree to which the encounter with Paris paradoxically made African American writers and artists more aware of and intent upon defining and articulating their Americanness, and finding in it a foundation for increased political activism and shaping of a Pan-African sensibility and community. This class will examine the literature, art, food, geographies and politics of African American expatriates in Paris, paying particular attention to the ways that the view from another shore shaped political thought and activism arising from a deepened awareness of national and international identity that Paris inspired.\n\n      less description for TRAVL-UG 9301 \u00ab",

BERLIN.\nSome of the most thrilling, momentous, and terrible events of the 1900\u2019s occurred in Berlin, Germany.    Today, Berlin's streets, buildings, and cultural monuments offer tales of warning and inspiration to the present century about the folly of nationalist ambition; inspiring sagas of intellectual and physical courage; cold testimonials of crime and retribution; lyrical ballads of brutal honesty; personal records of hope and despair.  This course, set in the heart of that city, will take in many of the sights and sounds of old and contemporary Berlin.  We will focus on the involvement of twentieth-century politicians and activists, artists and architects, bohemians and intellectuals with the causes, experience, and far-reaching consequences of World War II.  Our period of study begins just after  World War I and focuses first on the turbulent politics and culture of Weimar Berlin in the 1920's.  Then we consider the consolidation of Nazi power in the 1930's when Hitler declared Berlin his capital, and the seige on Berlin of 1945 that ended Hitler's Reich once and for all.   We look next at life in Berlin during the Cold War years and pay particular attention to the impact of the Wall (built in 1961) on the imaginations and realities of Berlin's citizens, and finally we assess our experiences of this reunited city as the the astonishing building boom that followed the fall of the Wall in 1989 slows down and the city faces its future as an EU capital.  Required class meetings include several seminars a week as well as related field trips intended to deepen our understanding of the readings, as well as the rich resources of the city\u2019s museums, neighborhoods, historical sites, memorials, and cultural monuments. There is a lot of required reading but students will find ample opportunity to explore Berlin and develop their own individual projects.  The course is taught in English but we also provide a few voluntary survival German language classes.\n\n      less description for TRAVL-UG 9500 \u00ab",

For the most part, many of these texts conclude that modernization must emulate the West, while  other scholars argue the futility of monetary aid efforts.  This course examines the shifting meaning of development from Africans and non-African thinkers. Is development a by-product of former colonial structures? In what ways do NGOs enhance or adversely affect developing nations? By exploring key texts that examine the problems of aid programs, strategies for structural and economic improvement, and ideas that address poverty, political instability and the rights of marginal groups, this course utilizes the disciplines of history, anthropology, and economics to better understand the merits and tensions of development in Africa.  Group site visits both in and out of Accra will allow for further immersion in the history and culture of the region, ranging from visits to Elmina Castle, local NGOs, the W.E.B.
