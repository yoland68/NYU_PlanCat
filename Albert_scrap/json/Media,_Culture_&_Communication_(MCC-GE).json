We will trace the genealogy of these visions, as they developed in tandem with the growing digital communications infrastructure over the past three quarters of a century, and evolved into new forms that even the most forward-thinking of visionaries could not have predicted. Ultimately, one can argue the the Internet has both exceeded and fallen short of the hype that surrounded its birth and development, and by comparing the myth to the reality, we may better understand what aspects of the human condition are likely to persist regardless of technological development.\n\n      less description for MCC-GE 2132 \u00ab",
