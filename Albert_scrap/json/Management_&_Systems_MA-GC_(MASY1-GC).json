Taking a learning-centric rather than information-centric approach, this course emphasizes the continuous acquisition and application of knowledge, and aims to build students' understanding of the impact of issues in resolving problems and taking advantage of opportunities relating to the exploration of organizational knowledge assets. There will be an emphasis in the course on collaboration rather than competition generating an experiential study of knowledge management in which the class will create knowledge in the form of papers on knowledge management, develop an evaluation system, evaluate the knowledge created, publish the information to a website, and evaluate their knowledge management. The aim is to create a community of practice and to maximize the experience of cooperation, knowledge creation, and trust in the learning environment, and to see how much can be achieved in a very intense, short amount of time because of this collaborative experience. The instructor will act as a facilitator of the creative experience rather than trying to push a personal learning agenda.   Upon successful completion of the course the student will have learned: how to define KM, learning organizations, intellectual capital and related terminologies in clear terms and understand the role of knowledge management in organizations; the best practices in corporate information search & taxonomy issues; the possibilities and limitations of collaborative software tools to support Communities of Practice; how to integrate knowledge into the enterprise; how to measure the effectiveness of KM initiatives; how to make tacit knowledge transfers easier and more effective (mentoring, capturing essential knowledge prior to retirement).\n\n      less description for MASY1-GC 3305 \u00ab",

The core focus of the class is in defining, discussing, and addressing the unique regulatory, cultural, and personal ethical dilemmas confronted by managers in the world economy of the twenty first century.   Many nuances and realities of formal (regulatory), global (cultural), and personal ethical risks will be presented for discussion and debate.  Case study examples will be addressed, including but not limited to, Lockheed, MCI, the Cuban Embargo, the South African and Israeli trade embargoes, and the Iraq oil for food embargoes. Postulation of example risks will be offered as stimulation for the student?s individual development of avoidance and/or resolution methodologies.  Formal and informal student classroom interaction will be crucial to stimulating the sharing of actual day to day business related ethical dilemmas. Classroom discussions will provide the baselines for identifying potential ethical conflicts that can be faced by managers as they manage cross-border, cross cultural and multi-ethnic organizations.   Development of possible resolutions will be proposed, dissected, evaluated and debated, within the parameters of both experienced and theoretical, ethically conflicting business situations.  Upon successful completion of this course, students will have gained a broad understanding of the existence of Ethical Risks, (regulatory, global and personal), in business, the skills with which to evaluate the impact of conflicting ethics on the geopolitical landscape, and a solid foundation for recognizing the need for both personal awareness of, and adjustment to, ethical risks in a global economy.\n\n      less description for MASY1-GC 3610 \u00ab",

This course focuses on the business decisions and management processes necessary to anticipate, plan for, manage, communicate about, and recover from crises affecting corporations and other complex organizations.  It will also cover the key component steps for the development of a corporate Business Continuity Plan as a vital part of the day to day operations of enterprises.   Additionally, it will examine the way companies in distress and the constituencies who matter to those companies predictably behave when things go wrong.  Underlying the tangible structural components of the course, there will be a continued emphasis on the fact that crisis management is an ongoing process, rather than a one time review of the individual corporations? operational requirements. Topics covered will include: The Crisis Environment Awareness and Training; Exercising & Maintaining Programs; Implementation Strategies & Issues; Emergency Preparedness & Response; Hazard Mitigation; Crisis Communications; Direction, Control & Coordination; Operations & Procedures; Logistics & Facilities; Recovery and continuity planning; Psychology paradigms in pre, during and post-crisis phases; Crisis Leadership; Integration of Multiple Disciplines, Functions and Organizational Constituencies; Performance Assessment; Current & Evolving Strategies and Insights in Crisis Management.  Through a combination of lectures, discussions, case studies, role-play, and a final project that consists of a crisis management plan to protect a company undergoing a crisis, students will be able to identify and implement the various plan development methodologies available today and be ready to develop and manage systems to establish protocols, processes, and structures to prevent damage and business interruption, and to restore operations in the event of a natural disaster.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will have learned how to recognize and appreciate the dynamics of crisis management including the processes involved in identifying areas of highest business interruption risk, the methodologies for calculating minimum recovery times for both systems and basic operations how to identify and address the key components necessary for the development and implementation of a viable crisis management program including a Business Continuity plan. They will have familiarity with the existence of numerous plan development software tools and they will have reviewed examples of existing plans.\n\n      less description for MASY1-GC 3615 \u00ab",
