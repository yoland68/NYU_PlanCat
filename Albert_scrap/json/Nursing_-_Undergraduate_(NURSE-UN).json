The class will assist students to understand and integrate knowledge of patho-physiologic concepts, mechanical ventilation, advanced hemodynamic monitoring, and interpretation of electrocardiographic monitoring, to emphasize patient assessment, treatment and evaluation of outcomes.  The student will learn to apply the nursing process as they collect, analyze, synthesize and interpret patient data and clinical information, establish priorities for the care of a critically ill patient, and develop a patient-centered, evidence-based collaborative plan of care for a patient and  his/her family.   The importance of the critical care nurse as patient advocate within the multidisciplinary team will be examined and strategies to improve communication between the team and the family will be discussed.\n\n      less description for NURSE-UN 1246 \u00ab",

Our discussions on the nature of comfort and suffering will focus on writings from a variety of sources including ancient works such as the Bible and the Koran, which will be contrasted with contemporary editorials and publications, in order to examine historical changes in the way individuals think about these important dimensions of the human experience.\n\n      less description for NURSE-UN 1303 \u00ab",
