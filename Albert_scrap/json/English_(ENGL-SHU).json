At the same time, as a content-based EAP course, it will aim to help you better understand, discuss, and apply some key concepts from social science and philosophy.  Specifically, this course will examine a distinction many have made in the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries (and earlier) between two ways of knowing and living that human beings exhibit.  These two ways are summed up in the course\u2019s title as 1) Massification (a.k.a. objectification, alienation, dehumanization) and 2) Humanization (a.k.a. authenticity, critical consciousness, liberation).  To examine this theme, the course will be further divided into four parts: (1) To begin, we will explore and discuss theories regarding how human beings psychologically & socially construct knowledge/reality. (2) We will then go on to apply these concepts in order to examine a critical feature of our modern world, namely how it is shaped by consumerism/materialism. (3) This will, in turn, lead us to examine the social, environmental, psychological effects consumerism is having on our world and ourselves. (4) This will finally lead us to examine some fundamental, philosophical questions human beings have asked for ages, such as:  What is happiness and how can it be attained? How can one live a meaningful life at this time? How can we improve our society (locally, national and globally)?

As this is a 101-level EAP seminar, students will be expected to show greater control of academic speaking and listening and greater autonomy over the learning process than they did in the 100-level seminar. Students will be expected to facilitate seminar discussions and deliver mid-length presentations. In order to become effective in communicating across cultural boundaries, one must first \u2018know thyself\u2019 and the way that cultural self is perceived by others. Just as a fish in water is not aware of the water, it is difficult to see the always shifting cultural contexts in which global citizens \u201cswim.\u201d At the core of the course is the idea that language and culture are inseparable. Linguistic competence itself is not enough for successful communication in a diverse multicultural world. Students will be engaged to conceptualize and practice intercultural communication and etiquette that is both verbal and non-verbal, question assumptions they have about \u201cnormal\u201d communication, and develop the ability to perceive and communicate from multiple intercultural points-of-view. They will also be prompted to develop their own set of intercultural values in light of what they have learned. As students engage with this content, they will practice high-level language, communication, and discourse skills required for the university setting, with an emphasis on speaking and listening. The EAP Seminar is designed to model a college classroom\u2014students will engage with the content of the course individually and in small groups; in formal and informal writing and speaking assignments; and by participating in group projects\u2014but there will be additional emphasis on refining and expanding English language skills.\n\n      less description for ENGL-SHU  101G \u00ab",

We will explore the history of scientific rhetoric by investigating two co-dependent narrative arcs in the \u201cstory\u201d of science: the way scientists write/talk/think in scientific discourse, and the way we write/talk/think about science and scientists.

We will explore the history of scientific rhetoric by investigating two co-dependent narrative arcs in the \u201cstory\u201d of science: the way scientists write/talk/think in scientific discourse, and the way we write/talk/think about science and scientists. For centuries, science bore little resemblance to the empirical discipline that we recognize today, yet, while modern science has claimed the language and tools of objectivity, it is wrong to believe that it is free of argument, controversy, and bias. We will consider how science emerged from philosophy, advanced, and adjusted its methodology through ages of renaissance, enlightenment, industrialization, and global expansionism, and usurped religion as the ultimate authority on the \u201cgreat\u201d questions of life along the way. We will discuss the genres of science writing, science in media and digital science, and debate questions of ethics and popularization. In parallel, we will look at the ways in which science and scientists have been portrayed in popular culture, literature and the visual arts, and equally, how a desire to appear \u201cscientific\u201d has influenced everything from literary theory to advertising.
