Working in, outside, andbetween places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas.\nThis course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.\n\n      less description for GCHN-SHU  263 \u00ab",

In recent decades, ideas like \u201cChinese transnationalism\u201d and the \u201crise of China\u201d have gained ground among popular and academic circles East and West; at times, they generate the nervous Exclusion-era imagination of a looming \u201cAsiatic takeover.\u201d Such a fervently growing imagination notwithstanding, this line of discourse and belief suggests a number of persistent problems in the studies of Chinese overseas, or Chinese diaspora: for one, while recognition of a global Chinese presence has taken on renewed importance in recent years, scholarly conversations have been modest and sporadic at best, when it comes to scrutinizing the full spectrum of migrant and diasporic cultures (both in and prior to the twentieth century) beyond the re-iterations of ethnic homogeneity, nationalist sentiments, nostalgia, and cultural alienation. Among the humanists, the failure to address long-term practices of social indigenization, multiethnic networks, and the change of cultural affinities makes our current historical juncture a particularly urgent one for reconsidering the meanings of these globalizing networks and the applicability of \u201cChinese\u201d to the inherently diverse diasporic articulations.\nMaterials of our study are drawn from multidisciplinary sources, including history, theory, fiction, and visual culture. Students learn toexplore the intricate conditions underlying the representations, making, and unmaking of Chinese subjectivities. Some topics of interest include Zheng He\u2019s now legendary maritime travels on the imperial treasure fleets, the opium trade and its implication for early transnational Chinese capitalism, labor migration and exclusion in North America, socio-political and cultural indigenization of Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, and the coolie trade in the Caribbean region.\n\n      less description for GCHN-SHU  264 \u00ab",
