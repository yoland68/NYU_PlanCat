We will pay particular attention to professional practice concerning the structure of the workday hours and turn around time and safety issues that are the responsibility of the producer, director, DP and shop steward. The course will explore techniques for on-set casting, location scouting, tech scouts, and read-thrus. Each student will be required to prepare a production book for his or her shoot by the end of class that will include a final marked script, script breakdown pages, shooting schedule, budget, cast, crew and location lists.  The script to work from will be provided by the instructor.\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 1296 \u00ab",

We will explore Processing beyond the Processing IDE, working with Processing in Eclipse, peeling back a layer to see how professional developers work with Processing and Java. Beyond simply learning to program, students in this class will explore models and algorithms useful for developing games.  We will discuss how platforms, libraries, frameworks, and engines affect game design, in both empowering and limiting ways.  Finally, we will discuss the history of digital games, how new tools have democratized the process of game development, and the costs and benefits of those trends.\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 1614 \u00ab",

The boldness of choice and degree of commitment demanded by comedy are what make it so difficult to perform, especially because bold choices must be supported by psychological truth. Characters' objectives, obsessions, needs and phobias are what compel them to act in comical ways; if actors don't find the pain and truth of these catalysts, their behavior becomes silly, and the comedy, shtick. The exercises employed in this course (many of which have their roots in commedia dell'arte) help participants to free their bodies and voices, allowing them to commit both boldly and truthfully, and will be used to analyze and bring to life comedic text from television, to movies and theater.\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 1910 \u00ab",

A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one\u2019s own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn\u2019t. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \u201ctoo far.\u201d The course may have a guest lecturer. \nNOTE: Everyone must bring 1 (ONE) original sketch idea to Class 1 that you will pitch in 3-4 sentences tops. (And perhaps write for Class 2.)\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 8012 \u00ab",

All students will be expected to complete a modest portfolio based on a subject of their own choosing.  Representative medium and large format cameras, as well as tripods and light meters will be provided.  Students will have the opportunity to work in a professional lab with excellent technical support.

This course introduces the special characteristics of large format photography, including perspective control, creative approaches to selective focus and metering strategies facilitated by single negative processing. The exposure and development methods known as the Zone System will also be considered. Because large format work is physically demanding and relatively slow, this is also an opportunity to work more deliberately and, in some respects, more consciously. It may also inform one\u2019s understanding of the methods and approaches of 19th and early 20th Century artists. \n\nThe high resolution of large format description can often produce a compelling image of relatively static subject matter that might not otherwise succeed if recorded in smaller formats. Surfaces and details evoke a more \u201ccomplete\u201d, or even tactile appreciation of some subjects. Following a series of practical exercises during the first half of the course, students are expected to develop an appropriate project on which to concentrate and apply their evolving skills in the production of an original and integrated body of work. Technical material covered includes different large format camera types and applications, lenses and optics, metering, filters, special B&W developers, large format printing and scanning for digital output. Early historical processes are introduced, current exhibitions of artists and photographers in New York are discussed and field trips are arranged.

While grounding in the basics of Photoshop and digital photography is assumed, early sessions will review basic tools to expand and better control these fundamental building blocks of digital imaging. Specifically we will explore creating and using layer masks and image effects, creating paths and shapes, custom fills and patterns. We will review working with layers, adjustment layers and text layers, as well as reviewing the details of resizing, sharpening, and image resolution for various output destinations.

However, thousands of affordable and pro-quality virtual instruments have been developed and released int he past decade alone. As you can imagine, navigating this space in an informed way is a daunting task.  This hands-on course will cover a broad spectrum of industry leading virtual instruments, effects and vocoders. By working through a series of practical activities, the students will gain an understanding of the skills necessary to program their own sounds using different types of synthesis.  The class will begin by introducing the basics of how synthesizers work, from concept to actual programming.  From that point the class will explore more elaborate methods of sound creation techniques that students will then be able to apply to any hardware or software synthesizer they may encounter.\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 8569 \u00ab",

Classroom lectures and lab time will all be used to bring these different educational vectors together into a coherent whole; the workshop will be organized around a single, long-term, hands-on, game creation project. Working in small groups under the close supervision of instructors, students will collaborate on the creation of a playable game. As a creative constraint to help inspire them and guide their designs, the students will be given a theme to express in their game projects.\n\n      less description for NCRD-UT 9512 \u00ab",
