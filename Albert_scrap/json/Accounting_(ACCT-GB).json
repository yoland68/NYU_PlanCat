Emphasis is placed on the limitations of accounting numbers given the largely intangible nature of the economic assets (e.g., subscriber bases, libraries, and brands) in these industries. The third part of the course is devoted to valuation of EMT firms using discounted cash flow and accounting-based and non-financial measures-based valuation approaches.\n\n      less description for ACCT-GB 3355 \u00ab",

This course is part of a sequence that is ideal for students who wish to pursue careers in investment banking, investment management, consulting, as well as public accounting. In addition to being a required course for accounting majors, it is a highly recommended course for majors in finance, economics, marketing and information systems.\n\n      less description for ACCT-GB 3360 \u00ab",
