We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination \u2013 in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism \u2013 in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms.  While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would \u201cdie out\u201d and later that they would or could be simply \u201cassimilated,\u201d we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called \u201cthe great Australian silence\u201d and asserting their right to a cultural future.  This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.\n\n      less description for ANTH-AD  102J \u00ab",

The disciplinary location for the course is in Social and Cultural Anthropology and History.  Caste is the lens through which a range of social and cultural issues such as gender, class, modernity and food are considered and communalism is the lens through which key historical moments are examined. Such key moments may include some of the following: Partition (1947), the State of Emergency (1975-77), Operation Bluestar (1984), the destruction of the Babri Masjid, Ayodhya (1992) and the Gujarat riots (2002).  In each case the events are studied from multiple perspectives both anthropological and historical to examine, for example, secularism and nationalism in India.\n\n      less description for ANTH-AD  110 \u00ab",
