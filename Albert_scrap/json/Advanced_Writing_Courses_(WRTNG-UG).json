Students submit four original pieces of criticism for workshop; readings may include works by Emily Nussbaum, A.O. Scott, Ellen Willis, John Jeremiah Sullivan, and others.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1042 \u00ab",

We read about the journalistic coverage of diverse people and events around New York City, examining hot-button issues surrounding race and class, and considering ways in which crime is covered in the news. Our focus on photojournalism, meanwhile, investigates intricacies and even controversies of photographic representation as we also visit and report on some of the city\u2019s visual offerings, be they formal installations, cultural events, or impromptu art. Throughout, we direct our attention to such concerns as the mediatized representation of others, journalistic ethics, and the politics of what kinds of news stories sell papers. Guest speakers may include NYC journalists, and city-based excursions are an important part of this seminar. Our readings derive from a number of disciplines (urban studies, sociology, journalism), and  authors may include Joan Didion, Henri Lefebvre and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as news articles from NYC papers and reflections by seasoned journalists, such as David Krajicek of the Daily News. This course does not teach how to be a reporter; rather, with the emphasis on critical reading, students learn to assess others\u2019 journalistic output and to understand how that journalistic work both informs and is informed by its social and political contexts. Students write reaction pieces and academic papers, give presentations, and create a photojournalism project on a subject of their choice.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1059 \u00ab",

How can studying the food of the South help us understand the popular mythology of our country as a whole?   In this course, we will read both scholarly and popular literature as well as watch and listen to various materials that dig into Southern food culture. We will tease apart what is so unique about the region and its pockets of vernacular cuisine, both in reality and in imagination. By putting Southern food under the magnifying glass, we will tease apart how various forms of media engage with historical and contemporary issues of race, class and gender by continually asking: Who is credited with \u201cinventing\u201d the cuisines of the American South? From whence do signature Southern ingredients really hail, and who has prepared them? How have branding, advertising, cookbooks and television massaged the Southern narrative in order to serve and perpetuate the romantic ideals of the Old South?  And in today\u2019s \u201cNew South,\u201d who is invited to, and who is still excluded from, the Southern table, both in reality and in popular narratives?  In this unique moment of Southern food\u2019s surge in popularity, we will pen our own stories about how the South is translated and represented gastronomically in our own locale, New York City.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1120 \u00ab",

We\u2019ll read both fiction and nonfiction, to analyze the function of the queer main character, the \u201cgay sidekick,\u201d the (far fewer) transgender characters in confessional narratives and novels, and the ways authors implicitly define their audience, as they write from an insider perspective or explain \u201cthe other\u201d to a mainstream culture.

The class will read and discuss a variety of texts that center around various modes of culture crossing, such as travel, tourism, and study abroad; immigration, expatriation and repatriation; and historical clashes and conflicts. Through an ongoing examination of structural and craft issues in the exemplary texts, students will make creative decisions to help write three main assignments dealing with themes of Memory, Identity and Conflict. We'll use our discussions of Memory to help focus on expository and reflective rhetorical strategies, Identity as a way to experiment with point of view and character development, and Conflict as a method for exploring structure and dramatic tension. In order to write cross-culturally about personal experiences, students will be encouraged to create texts along the spectrum between creative nonfiction and autobigraphical fiction. Theoretical essays will help inform how we ethically position ourselves as writers observing cultures not (necessarily) our own in order to inform audiences and to challenge our own prejudices. Through it all, we'll consider how formal experiments across genres may help illuminate experiences and confront perceptions. Authors to be read include Gloria Anzaldua, Staceyann Chin, Edwidge Danticat, Junot Diaz, Randa Jarrar, V.S. Naipaul, Mary Louise Pratt, Salman Rushdie, Edward Said, Marjane Satrapi, Amy Tan, and Le Thi Diem Thuy.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1230 \u00ab",

In the advanced writing course, students will concentrate on writing and editing for multiple platforms. In the arts workshop, students will focus on print media and design. In addition, students in both classes will have the opportunity to commission and edit both written text and art works from one another. Each class will meet two times a week: once with its designated professor, and once as a collaborative lab with both classes and both professors. The lab will be devoted to the conception, development, and production of publications that will each include a 32-page print prototype and new media elements. Lab days will also enable students to meet with guest speakers from the worlds of publishing and design; and go on field trips to the offices of contemporary experimental magazines and relevant institutions and archives.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1250 \u00ab",

His elegantly haunting books (which blurred novel, history, and memoir) couldn't be more different from the typical posts that proliferate in the so-called blogosphere. Yet Internet writing, with its hyperlinks and screen-grabs, calls upon a magpie instinct that Sebald and other illustrious writers would instantly recognize. This course takes students on a tour of writing methods old and new, imparting a ravenous approach to composition useful for work in any genre: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and the borderlands of our virtual reality. Classes will focus on the use of images in text, the cento, the footnote, the double-jointed review, and more. Writing will include frequent in-class experiments and several longer assignments. Students will read works by Nicholson Baker, Alison Bechdel, Harry Stephen Keeler, Raymond Queneau, and others.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1317 \u00ab",

We'll consider these and other questions through readings of novels and short stories that depict their contemporary political and cultural events. We'll pay particular attention to the ways these writers borrow, subvert, or reinvent journalistic (or \"new\" journalistic) techniques. Students will be expected to produce several written exercises, as well as two longer fictional pieces (short stories or novel chapters) that take current events as a starting point for narrative. These will be discussed through in-class workshops. Readings may include John Updike's Rabbit Redux, Joan Didion's Democracy, Don Delillo's Mao II, and Brett Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero, as well as short stories by Grace Paley, Alicia Erian and Martin Amis.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1339 \u00ab",

Through the reading of monologues, interviews, and oral histories in various formats (poetry, performance text, literary journalism, memoir, archive, theatre, video and film), students will consider the motives for placing spoken or spontaneous language down on the page to read as a permanent text.  Journalistic interviews with a family or community member will inform an assignment to write a profile, as students determine how to best represent their own voice alongside the speech of their subject. We'll also use oral history methodology to collect the accounts of a group of people, examining conflicts and discrepancies among individual stories as an opportunity to explore form. Students will then use transcriptions of their interviews to inform a historical piece in a genre (or mixed genre) of their choice: poetry, nonfiction, or performance text.  Authors to be read include Anna Deavere Smith, Studs Terkel, Spalding Gray, Sherman Alexie and Ntozake Shange. We'll also visit an oral history archive as well as mine the crafted \"archives\" of Def Poetry Jam, the Moth live storytelling series, and Meem (a Beirut-based queer women's group) for inspiration.\n\n      less description for WRTNG-UG 1341 \u00ab",
