Subjects will include the role of the photograph during the recent war in Iraq, its heavy use in the field of \"multimedia,\" its problematic function as social critic, the imagery emerging from other cultures, the clarion call for improved visual literacy, and photography's use in cyborg culture.. We will also look at related trends in other media including film, video, music and hypertext. After more than 150 years in which photographs have proliferated, this course will look at how we have been changed by them, and how we can arrive at some understanding of this newly digital \"image culture\" around us in order to discern where it might be taking us.\n\n      less description for OART-UT   12 \u00ab",

The course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, arrays, functions, objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as image processing, networking, data parsing and computer vision. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle.   While the example applications will be primarily in a screen based, visual domain, motivated students are encouraged to incorporate more physical interface to their projects using tools such as the Arduino.

The microcontroller used in this class is called Arduino, is much more accessible than previous microcontrollers and is intended specifically for artists and hobbyist. The core technical concepts of the class include digital, analog and serial input and output. You'll also learn how microcontrollers communicate with other computers.  Physical computing takes a hands-on approach, which means that you spend a lot of time building circuits, soldering, writing programs, building structures to hold sensors and controls, and figuring out how best to make all of these things relate to a person's expression. Students have weekly lab exercises to build skills with the microcontroller and related tools, and longer assignments in which they apply the principles from weekly labs in creative applications.

The works of iconic filmmakers who embrace and use film as an original, vibrant and reflective art form are reviewed throughout the course. Extracts and readings from relevant filmmakers are given throughout the course.\n\n      less description for OART-UT  140 \u00ab",

The art of portraiture has survived its own origins in myth making and archetype building. The human image, or icon, forever landmarks the voices, textures, physicality, spirituality, symbols, politics, aesthetic concerns and military contexts, religious rituals, government, calendar ceremonies, daily functions, heroic acts and social disorders of diverse cultures throughout recorded history. It is the history of creation, the story of romance, the mark of progress, the record of royalty and the profile of democracy. It is the revolution of fine art and a catalyst of discipline. Imaging the individual in the public eye is the story of humankind. This course bridges the worlds of the oral and written mythologies which inhabit and empower us and the creative manifestation (conscious and unconscious) of these ancient archetypes into contemporary art, media and design. Students will critically rethink the implied and material presence of portraiture in everyday life. Students will gain practical knowledge and insight into the origins and potential power of the archetypes which permeate our collective unconscious.\n\n      less description for OART-UT  826 \u00ab",

This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings, which also include more personal themes such as loss and melancholy, the ephemeral nature of time and memory, nostalgia and change.\n\nWe will study several different kinds of visual poetics such as combining documentary photos with literature, artists working with archives and found images, the personal essay film, ethnographic poetics, photo reportage and new media visual storytelling, mixed media and public projections. Some of the writers and artists we will study include Alfredo Jaar, W.G.

We will study the impact of Cuban cultural policy dictated by Fidel Castro in 1961 and in 1970 through documents of the period, which determined the course of Cuban \narts for decades. We will continue with a survey of the visual arts on the island and consider how they constituted highly sophisticated interpretations of the always changing reality, whether in painting of the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s or installation practice of the 1990\u2019s. Classic documentaries and films by prestigious Cuban filmmakers (Santiago Alvarez and Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea) will be reviewed and analyzed, and we will conclude with an analysis of the most recent artistic expressions: Cuban hip-hop music and the edgy video works of Ernesto Oroza, Henry Eric Hern\u00e1ndez, and other young artists. In this most recent work, political criticism, Cuban history and deconstructive techniques collide, reflecting the multiple layers of Cuban culture and its continuing development today. The course will include visits to the Center of Cuban Studies and to The 8th Floor Gallery in New York to discuss Cuban artworks in view.\n\n      less description for OART-UT  832 \u00ab",

In the former, one learns the basic tenets of playwriting. In the latter, one is expected to get cracking on his or her first masterpiece. Rarely do we see an opportunity for a burgeoning playwright to not just learn the fundamentals, but to also begin to discover his or her artistic voice. How many potentially successful writers have given up just because they never knew where their strengths lay? What if a young writer is slogging away trying to write boulevard comedies, when, in fact, he or she has an incredible knack for experimental theater? Or vice versa? This is where Discovering The Writer\u2019s Voice comes in.\n\nThis is a class built on artistic experimentation. Works of notable playwrights of various styles and backgrounds will be read and discussed, in order to discover various possible approaches to writing, in terms of theatricality, character development (or non-development), dialogue style, etc. After the characteristics of a given playwright\u2019s style have been agreed upon, the students will then be assigned an 8-15 page play, wherein they incorporate the listed aspects of the playwright\u2019s work. This is not meant to be an imitation or, worse, a parody of the assigned writer\u2019s work. Students will instead write plays with themes, topics, and characters that are of interest to them, but following certain guidelines. Over the course of the semester, students will write three short plays, each featuring the \u201cstyle\u201d of an assigned playwright. Ideally, students will thrive in some styles and struggle mightily in others.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1043 \u00ab",

Unpacking this sonic history reveals how identity is connected to how race is heard, both historically and at present. In this course, we explore how race is constructed in the development of global popular music and the culture of sound in and before the 20th century in the United States. This course, in particular, will especially focus on music of the global African Diaspora from the late nineteenth century until the 1960s. We will examine how the sounds and performance of blackface minstrelsy\u2014the first native form of popular music in the U.S.\u2014became the basis of contemporary popular sound, ranging from Tin Pan Alley to blues and jazz, as well as to country and rock \u2018n roll. Irving Berlin, Big Momma Thornton, Elvis Presley, The Supremes, Johnny Cash, Mick Jagger, Tina Turner, and Jimi Hendrix are but a few of the many artists who will be considered in relation to the history of American popular music and (racialized) sound. Students will consider critical race theories, primary and secondary accounts of popular performance, as well as selected audio and visual material to investigate how race ties into various ideas about individual and community identity, nationalism, and imperialism. In addition, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the relationship between sound, race, and American Music, as they develop critical listening skills to deconstruct how music is performed, heard, and embodied in more contemporary contexts through lectures, discussion, as well as multimedia and written projects. While racial identity will remain central to how we deconstruct the sounds and performance of popular music, aspects of identity such as gender, class, and sexuality will also be closely considered.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1153 \u00ab",

We will look at all of the platforms where music is supervised and licensed, including film, television, advertising, video games, and more. We will also discuss the impact of music supervision from a creative perspective by looking at case studies such as Lorde curating the Hunger Games Soundtrack, the music side of The Tonight Show, Apple using Hudson Mohawke's music in their advertisement campaign, and how DJ Hero changed the landscape of music in video games forever. The final class project will involve supervising and licensing music in real-time, using all of the knowledge gained in class, and applying it to the real world.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1273 \u00ab",

Both courses meet during the second seven weeks of the semester.\n \nSection 001 Immersive Experiences: If you've been to a 3D or Imax movie, if you've tried Google glasses, if you've listened to music on surround sound speakers or noise-canceling headphones, if you\u2019ve explored an interactive website, visual album, pop up store or app, or visited the Burning Man Festival, you are a consumer of immersive experiences. One of the main drivers of culture and technology in the 21st century, immersion is defined as the process by which one or more of the senses become saturated as environmental objects surround envelope or come in closer proximity to us. Virtual or augmented reality, innovative video games, and the idea that consumers area always \u201cplugged in\u201d via mobile devices are just some of the ways we experience immersion in contemporary commercial terms. But the concept is not new: scholars like Benjamin, McLuhan, and Debord have long been concerned with theorizing the \u201csensorium\u201d and media spectacle. Immersion underwrites so many developments in media and elsewhere: film close-ups, site-specific theater, photography, daguerrotypes and dioramas, haunted houses, house of mirrors and certain forms of installation art. Immersion is also widely considered to be the key to learning new languages or mastering different cultures and tourism, so it plays a key role in 20th and 21st century globalization. This class looks at the global history and culture of immersion in various cultural traditions and how emergent technology has impacted immersion. It also considers how our ongoing demand for proximity has shaped contemporary entertainment and technological needs; immersion is now a multi-billion dollar global business. We especially look at immersion in popular music \u2013 spanning everything from Satie to ambient music to surround sound and panoramic sound and Dolby to theme parks to 21st century \u2018experience websites,\u2019 spectacular live shows, app culture, brand experiences, pop-up stores, holograms and holophonics. Students should leave the class with greater understanding of immersion as a cultural principle and a better knowledge of how entertainment industries will be meeting consumer need for immersion in the past now and into the future. \n \nSection 002 Diasporic Sounds: In the early modern era, the movement, migration, and dispossession of Europeans and Africans to the \u201cNew World\u201d encouraged the transmission of diverse cultural practices within new contexts. In particular, the \u201cAfrican Diaspora\u201d was forged, as multiple tribes and ethnicities were forcibly transported throughout the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. In the Americas, varied forms of traditional African life and culture were both preserved and transformed within the confines of enslavement, while distinct ethnic practices converged in newly formed communities and settings, as well as in relation to (ethnic) European Diasporic practices. The topics of this course will travel across the Atlantic and three centuries, as we explore how the sounds of the African Diaspora have been (per)formed, transmitted, circulated, and commodified within the development of popular sounds in the Americas. Diasporic Sounds will begin by engaging the spiritual, improvisatory, rhythmic, and corporeal aspects of how sounds of the African Diaspora were (re)created throughout the New World. Focusing on the United States, the Caribbean, and Brazil, this course will continue to explore the ways in which these diasporic sounds both related and differed across regions and contexts, reflecting the diversity implicit within how we investigate (Africa\u2019s) Diaspora. While the course considers the specific contexts of Africans throughout the Americas, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between identity and popular sound by considering how sounds of the African Diaspora became thematized, commodified, and circulated in the context of an increasingly industrial and globalized world economy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As we explore the range, singularity, and hybridity of (African) Diasporic sounds, we will also cover a number of genres and their performers, including (but not limited to) the folk spiritual of the U.S., Haitian Compas, blackface minstrelsy, samba, Hip Hop, Bomba, Cuban jazz, and reggaeton, in addition to styles such as bluegrass, techno, and British soul.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1286 \u00ab",

This course examines theoretical genealogy of the concept and its contemporary application in the context of a case study of Iran, a Middle Eastern country with almost no direct American tourist and educational access in the last 35 years and yet voluminous mediated access to archives of often hyperbolic and partisan geopolitical debates, a famous national arthouse cinema, lively Iranian and diasporic art and documentary media, state/citizen-driven public diplomacy video-journalism etc. For this course, therefore, familiarity with and critical assessment of rich moving-image media archives becomes the point of entry into understanding the country historically within the Cold War context of a large scale involvement of American government and non-government institutions in social and economic modernization, political transformation and cultural policies affecting artistic movements inside Iran and the diaspora. This course encourages students to develop \"activist\" relation with the country through establishing social media contact and reflecting on their mediated artistic access. The course is structured around group projects, online assignments, journal reports, short theory paper and a documentary presentation of final project. No prior knowledge of Iran and/or Persian languages are required for a successful completion of this course.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1500 \u00ab",

In contrast to first-person shooters, LookingGlass\u2019 first-person games were experiments in simulation, storytelling, and interface that were years ahead of their time, and formed a vocabulary still used today for building stories in real-time virtual worlds.\n\nThis is a history class with a forensic structure. Students will play through, discuss, read and write about Looking Glass\u2019 games, with emphasis put on their core \u201cimmersive design trilogy\u201d of Ultima Underworld, System Shock, and Thief and how all these works influenced and revised each other. Students will also play other games of the era for context, read articles about and interviews with the developers, and complete a series of assignments to structure their understanding.\n\nThe immediate goal is to foster a deep understanding of the work and influence of a seminal game company, the way one would for any other important group of artists in an art history context. The larger goal is to foster a set of skills for historical and critical analysis that is culturally situated and which complicates the notion of sole authorship.\n\nThis course is for students interested in the culture and evolution of video game aesthetics and who understand and value the practice of close reading and comparative analysis, the way a serious student would be expected to when studying the works of a painter.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1616 \u00ab",

Pioneer documentarians like Dziga Vertov and Robert Flaherty saw in documentary film the ability to portray life with a kind of truthfulness never before possible.  Early Polish filmmaker Boleslaw Matuszewski wrote that while \u201cthe cinematograph does not give the whole truth at least what it gives is unquestionable and of an absolute truth.\u201d  Since those heady days, it has become all too clear that documentaries have no special access to the truth. Nevertheless, as this still-young art evolved, documentarians of different schools constantly sought new means to tell the human story. Documentary filmmaking has always been a blend of artistry and technical means and we will also explore this critical relationship.  \n\nThe course explores the development of the documentary and the shifting intentions of documentary filmmakers through the evolution of narrative approach and structure paying special attention to the documentary tradition\u2019s relationship to journalism. Students examine how different filmmakers have gone about trying to convey \u201creality\u201d on screen both through the use and avoidance of narration, through interviews, editing and dramatizations.  \n\nThroughout the semester, students investigate how image-driven medium attempts to report stories and the ways an emotion-driven art can be problematic for journalistic objectivity.  Finally, the ethical and journalistic responsibilities the documentary filmmaker are discussed.  Special attention is given to dramatic re-creations, the filmmaker\u2019s relationship to his/her subjects and the construction of narrative through editing.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1701 \u00ab",

The object of this training is how to withstand and perhaps circumvent the many obstacles that lie ahead and, by planning, gain the freedom to act spontaneously during production. Along with screenings and class discussions, the instructor, an Oscar winning producer/director, and guest filmmakers will share their proposals and budgets and talk about how their films adhered to or changed from original/preproduction plans. Students enrolled in the course are asked to bring in ideas in writing for a documentary film they would like to make.

Throughout the course of the semester, students will work on a monologue and a scene for action-based acting and character work. Students will be expected to prepare and rehearse material outside of class and will be paired for a final assignment of preparing a Shakespeare scene for rehearsal and presentation in class. Monologue and scene suggestions will be provided from a list handed out by the instructor. This is not a lecture-based seminar on Shakespeare\u2019s writing, but rather an introductory approach to analyzing text for clues and insights into performing Shakespeare\u2019s works.

If drama holds a mirror up to life, comedy holds up a magnifying glass. The boldness of choice and degree of commitment demanded by comedy are what make it so difficult to perform, especially because bold choices must be supported by psychological truth. Characters' objectives, obsessions, needs and phobias are what compel them to act in comical ways; if actors don't find the pain and truth of these catalysts, their behavior becomes silly, and the comedy, shtick. The exercises employed in this course (many of which have their roots in commedia dell'arte) help participants to free their bodies and voices, allowing them to commit both boldly and truthfully, and will be used to analyze and bring to life comedic text from television, to movies and theater.\n\n      less description for OART-UT 1910 \u00ab",
