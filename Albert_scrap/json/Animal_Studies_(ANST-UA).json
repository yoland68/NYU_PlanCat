Specifically, it examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves.  We will explore the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories.  We will also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness.

Fundamentally, students will learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on.\n\n      less description for ANST-UA  200 \u00ab",

This workshop-cum-seminar will engage with key themes in recent \u201cpost-humanist\u201d discourse by applying and testing them in our own creative practice. We will read recent theories of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors, Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear, Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo). Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space, objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic implications of these theoretical ideas. A main interest of this course is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making as well as by thinking/writing/speaking. Prior artistic training/practice is welcomed but not required; however, all students must be willing to and interested in exploring their \"inner artist.\"\n\n      less description for ANST-UA  393 \u00ab",

We start by asking about the nature of moral rights and duties. What are rights, and where do they come from? How do we resolve conflicts among rights? Do animals have rights? Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species?

Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We then ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or companionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy? Here we consider abolition vs. regulation, incrementalism vs. absolutism, and legal reform vs. direct action.\n\n      less description for ANST-UA  400 \u00ab",

Do they have free will? Do they live meaningful lives? Do they have moral rights? This involves applying concepts from ethics, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy to our conclusions about animal minds. Finally, we also ask, along the way, how research on animal minds can affect our philosophical theories. For example, should we revise our theories of consciousness, language, agency, morality, and so on if they seem to have implausible implications about animals?\n\n      less description for ANST-UA  410 \u00ab",
