Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and \u2018pagan\u2019 realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah\u2019s Cosmopolitanism and Said\u2019s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland\u2019s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.\n\n      less description for COREP-AD    1W \u00ab",

While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man\u2019s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).\n\n      less description for COREP-AD   42 \u00ab",

Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important?  When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey.

This course examines the relationship between pilgrimage and enlightenment.  Is pilgrimage a metaphor of a life well lived, or must it be a literal journey in search of a higher state of being?  Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important?  When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey.  We begin our journey in India with Ashvagosha's Life of the Buddha, and then follow a trail of religious cultural production \u2013 including sutras, mandalas, and records of individual pilgrims \u2013 that culminates in the Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West.  The course then turns to \"Non Eastern\" adaptations of Journey, including Maxine Hong Kingston's Tripmaster Monkey and such films as The Lost Empire, before closing with comparisons of Buddhist pilgrimage with the Hajj, as well as \u201cmodern Western\u201d journeys to Asia in search of spiritual alternatives to material civilization.\n\n      less description for COREP-AD   54 \u00ab",

How have ideologies of gender been central to colonial and nationalist projects from the nineteenth century to the present? How does gender shift in the context of diaspora, migration, and globalization? We approach these questions through a consideration of aesthetic practices and representational forms \u2013 literature, film, visual art \u2013  that suggest alternatives to a binary logic of gender and instead articulate different visions of gender justice. We will examine literary texts by Shakespeare, Charlotte Bronte, Jean Rhys, Assia Djebar, Shyam Selvadurai, Shani Mootoo, and Mahasweta Devi; films such as Gilo Pontecorvo\u2019s The Battle of Algiers and Deepa Mehta\u2019s Earth; and contemporary visual art from the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\n      less description for COREP-AD   55 \u00ab",

For example, what does the death sentence passed on Socrates (for corrupting the youth with his philosophical ideas) tell us about classical Athens? How does Plato create a foundational myth of Western philosophy out of this criminal sentence? The intersections of literature, film and policing have fundamentally shaped the emergence and development of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence, authorship, and authority. We will investigate these terms together with the ways crime and the criminal have been defined through time and in different cultures, using the lenses of literature, film, and visual culture. Works by Plato, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Franz Kafka, Lu Xun, Jorge Lois Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Herta M\u00fcller, Fritz Lang, Akira Kurosawa, Jean-Luc Godard, and Abbas Kiarostami, among others.\n\n      less description for COREP-AD   56 \u00ab",

The question is how a sense of place can persist in the face of all this movement and interaction.

How does the experience of displacement or contact with the outside change our relation to place? Is there a reaction to place that transcends nostalgia for lost origins?  If displacement is valued over placement do the experiences of men predominate? The theoretical and fictional readings will center on the shaping force of place in human experience and the primacy of setting and landscape in narratives.\n\n      less description for COREP-AD   58 \u00ab",
