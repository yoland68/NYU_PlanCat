Extended study tours to Florence, Siena, Volterra, Pienza, Spoleto, Orvieto, San Gimignano, Assisi, and Perugia will be taken. \n\nWe will focus on central issues and ideas that comprised the consciousness of the masters of aesthetics of the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance and their passion for beauty. Artistic and literary expressions essentially embedded in the realms of metaphysics and society, sometimes become indelible by their transformation of pure thought into a pattern of human behavior.\n\nStudents must be covered by health insurance prior to traveling abroad.\n\n      less description for SABR1-UC 5818 \u00ab",
