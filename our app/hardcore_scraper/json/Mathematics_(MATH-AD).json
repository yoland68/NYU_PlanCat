This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product and cross product multiplications. The course further provides an in-depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities, including double angle and half angle formulas and their application. The concepts of average rate of change, limit and derivatives for both scalars and vectors in two and three-dimensional coordinates are discussed and the merits of each are presented. Systems of linear equations are presented using matrices. Finite and infinite sequences are discussed. Some basic properties of real and complex numbers are reviewed and several applications of the algebra of complex numbers are presented to illustrate how to use them in applications.\n\n      less description for MATH-AD  102 \u00ab",
