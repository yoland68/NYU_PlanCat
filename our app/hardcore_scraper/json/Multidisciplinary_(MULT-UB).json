This course aims to develop a more educated perception of the law so that it becomes less intimidating. The objective is to equip students with a basic level of savvy and analytical ability in relation to law. To do this, we will watch  films over the course of the semester and learn to spot legal issues in a variety of scenarios, from personal life to business transactions. Discussions will then go into how such issues can impact the individuals and entities involved, how they can be resolved, what the ramifications of those issues are in the bigger scheme of society, and what kind of examples actually do exist in both historical and contemporary case law. While this is a Stern course, it is not limited to business law and rather, is a broad overview of law as viewed through film.\n\n      less description for MULT-UB   23 \u00ab",
