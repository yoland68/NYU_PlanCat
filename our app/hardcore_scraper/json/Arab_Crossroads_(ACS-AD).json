Surveillance and control engulf the daily lives of millions of citizens; political activists are silenced, jailed, tortured, sometimes executed; wars are waged against unruly political movements, regions, even entire countries. This unprecedented level of repression shows the resilience of authoritarianism. It also shows, paradoxically, the vitality and efficiency of political movements in the Arab World. How do citizens organize under surveillance and repression? What resources do they draw on, what strategies do they adopt to propose alternative political projects? Students will study contentious politics in the region since 1945, from Arab nationalism to socialism, unionism, communism, and Islamism. They will explore the making of contention in the various sites where organized action crystallized, from fields, factories, and oilrigs to streets, universities, and mosques. They will analyze the 2011 uprisings and their aftermaths, including the latest episodes of repression and militarization.\n\n      less description for ACS-AD  235X \u00ab",

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.",
