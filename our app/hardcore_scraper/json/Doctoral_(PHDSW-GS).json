The objectives of this course are to develop and deepen an understanding of quantitative methods used in clinical research; to identify the phases of conducting research; to acquaint course participants with a variety of approaches to the study of clinical practice. Special emphasis will be placed on generating researchable questions, measurement, scale assessment, questionnaire and interview data collection instruments and their construction, the development of other types of instruments, sampling methods, and preparing data for analysis. The importance of sensitivity to measurement and response issues across diverse populations will be stressed. The course aims to provide students with some actual experience in the location and assessment of measures of constructs used in clinical research. Furthermore the course will provide experience in the development and piloting of an instrument, and an introduction to basic data handling.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3027 \u00ab",

Modes of teaching and learning and their relationship to subject matter, settings, and educational outcomes will be considered, and students' concurrent teaching activities will be used for reflective learning.  In spring, the course will be project-based. Specifically, the MSW Program at NYU is asking for proposals on how best to evaluate the educational effectiveness of the Program. The instructor and the students will plan together how to develop one or more proposals as well as how the usual topics in the course can be addressed. Hence the course in spring, will offer a real-life exercise in educational planning and the evaluation of social work education.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3033 \u00ab",

In order to contribute to the further evolution of the profession, it is critical for students to understand policy inputs, including economic, social, political and cultural values that influence policy decisions, as well as to gain a critical understanding of theories of social work practice as they relate to the contemporary world. Moreover, as part of this process of inquiry, it is important to develop critical thinking about policy outputs, including the analysis of the process of policy implementation and policy products.  This course will provide a critical view of the development of social work as a discipline and as a profession in the United States. The past 100 years of social work will be examined within the contest of evolving social welfare policies and political events influencing policy choices. The tension and dialectic between elements of the social work profession itself will be analyzed with a view toward encouraging the student to develop his/her own nuanced view of the role of the profession in the future. The course will also examine the political processes, ideology and economic processes in terms of their relevance for the development of social policies. The influence of contemporary social forces on the profession will be explored as well as the reaction of social work to these phenomena. The relationship of theory to social policy will also be explored, including feminist theory. Finally, an introduction to the critical analysis of contemporary social policies as they relate to social work practice will be examined.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3048 \u00ab",

The emphasis in this course is on the differing purposes of each type of research design and the varying ways each typically approaches such issues as sampling and data collection. Coherence of design is emphasized. Examples of classic and recently published studies illustrating each type of design will be examined in depth to understand its use. Because social work research takes place in a diverse world, the course covers enhancing the cultural competence of one's approach to research. Research ethics will also be considered because they are basic to all sound research designs. Thus this course serves as the foundation from which students will move on to consider qualitative and quantitative methods in greater depth.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3049 \u00ab",

There will also be an initial segment focusing on the conceptual foundations of social work as a profession.  Philosophy of science enters into our work as intellectual leaders in the clinical-research domain in three ways. First, philosophy of science addresses fundamental general issues concerning the nature of knowledge, the evaluation of research, and preferable research methodologies across the sciences, and how to reason scientifically. Second, within social work itself, the debates in philosophy of science have found expression in specific disputes and divisions among social work researchers that can only be understood in the context of philosophy of science. And third, philosophy of science, in addressing the nature of theory change and rational assessment of beliefs, can be construed as indirectly addressing a perennial question in clinical theory: how can the therapist come to understand the client's theory of the world, by what evidence (or other processes) is the client's theory of the world maintained, and by what techniques might this theory be changed? In the course of these sessions, we will attempt to consider all three of these facets or levels of the interaction of philosophy of science with clinical research.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3050 \u00ab",

Historic tensions between social work's dual interest in changing individual behavior and the reform of institutional arrangements that constrain clients in their quest for self- actualization, assume new dimensions in the 21st century with the globalization of the economy, dislocation, increasing inequality, and world-wide violation of human rights. These trends challenge social work scholars, policy makers and practitioners to critically evaluate assumptions underlying policy development and social theory to remain true to social work's s historic commitment to social justice within a society of increasing diversity and growing social exclusion. The course builds of content of the first year of doctoral study and encourages the use of critical thinking and the advancement of empirical knowledge to support socially just policy, practice and theory development in light of contemporary societal trends. Integrating social work's historic concern for social justice and the implications of societal trends for the equitable distribution of societal resources, the course encourages critical thinking and an expanded theoretical knowledge base to support varied approaches to direct services with diverse client groups anchored in a social justice perspective. The course initially examines the philosophical underpinnings of social work and social justice as an organizing principle of the profession, theories shaping contemporary direct social work practice and frameworks for social welfare policy analysis. The second half of the course applies this content in selected social welfare policy domains through in-class student presentations focused on a specific social problems and target populations. Finally, the course looks at implications of professional trends emphasizing evidence based-practice and leadership challenges for clinical social work in the 21st century.\n\n      less description for PHDSW-GS 3059 \u00ab",

This motive has significant implications for the sampling and data collection methods that are used.

The course will include the following:  when survey research is and is not the best method to use; the modes of conducting surveys (paper questionnaire, on-line questionnaire, interview) and determining which is the best for a given study; sampling considerations and decisions (e.g. is a probability sample possible for a given study?  if not, how should one go about recruiting the sample?); sample size considerations; when is response rate important and methods for increasing it; designing a reliable, unbiased, and effective data collection instrument that will answer the study questions and hypotheses; the importance and value of independent variables; importance of and methods for pretesting instruments; survey management, data cleaning and preparation; and special issues in survey research, e.g. surveying about sensitive topics, cross-cultural surveys.
