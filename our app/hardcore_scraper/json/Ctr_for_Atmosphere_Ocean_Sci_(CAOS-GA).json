To help understand and reinforce the underlying theoretical concepts of geophysical fluid dynamics as presented in other course work, the students will operate a laboratory turntable and perform experiments that demonstrate the roles of rotation and stratification in atmospheric and oceanic circulations on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.
