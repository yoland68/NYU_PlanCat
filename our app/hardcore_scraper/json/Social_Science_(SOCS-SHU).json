All students will take the class together and enrollment is capped at 24 students.  Students will submit applications to the class during the summer of 2014, stating the reasons for their interest, and receive word of their selection by the NYUSH administration by mid-August. Students will be instructed on various public speaking tips and will be given assignments outside of class and various exercises in class to learn what goes into an effective speech or presentation and how to enhance their public speaking skills. They will read, listen to, and analyze some of the world\u2019s greatest speeches; take part in both individual and team-based public speaking exercises; and receive detailed feedback from the instructor and classmates on content, style, organization, and delivery. The aims are that by the conclusion of the class, students will be familiar with numerous different types of speeches and presentations, will understand how leaders can use their public speaking skills to good effect, will have learned both how to employ positive speech techniques and to minimize negative speech habits, and will have more confidence in their own public speaking ability.\nThe course will be offered for 2 credit hours. Attendance is mandatory, as no part can be repeated or replicated.\nInstructor\nThis course will be led by Diane C. Yu, Esq., the Deputy President of NYU, based in New York. She has taught the University Leadership Honors Course at NYU in NY since 2002 and has been teaching a leadership class in Abu Dhabi to the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Scholars since 2008 and the Leadership and Public Speaking class at the NYUAD Summer Academy since 2011. Prior to her NYU arrival in 2001 she had been a successful lawyer in the U.S. (Managing Counsel for a large corporation, General Counsel to the State Bar of California, White House Fellow, Superior Court Commissioner in California, and in private law practice).

The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data.

I am looking forward to an exciting term of thinking about what the U.S. Constitution means and whether its ideas and rules can or should be exported to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n American constitutional law is important and interesting, but it is also inherently\nconfusing. My chief goal is to minimize the confusion that the material presents, in hopes that we can get some insight on what it means for the Constitution to supply rules of law conferring and limiting governmental officials\u2019 authority.\n Understanding the U.S. Constitution can be difficult for two reasons. First, American constitutional law purports to limit very powerful political actors with law-making and law-enforcing authority \u2013 members of Congress, state legislatures, governors, Presidents, judges,etc. It is not obvious how a piece of paper, a mere parchment barrier, can limit such actors. We know how ordinary law controls private people: If you disobey ordinary law, then the police might put you in jail, or a judge may force you to pay a fine. But constitutional law tries to tell the judge and police what to do. Why should they listen? Who will put them in jail if they ignore the law? How does a mere piece of paper limit (for instance) the President, who is himself or herself the chief executive with control over federal law enforcement? Unlike ordinary law, constitutional law requires powerful political actors voluntarily to obey the rules.\n The \u201creal\u201d constitution that judges and other politically powerful people actually follow, therefore, can be very different from the written constitution. Some of these hidden constitutional rules are contained in the hearts and minds of most Americans: They are unspoken assumptions about how We the People should be governed. For instance, \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d \u2013 the idea that a majority of citizens should control the government, because they represent everyone, including the minority of citizens \u2013 is one of those assumptions. Some of these rules and principles are more explicit: tTey are contained in the official interpretations of the written Constitution by judges, the Congress, the President, or important lawyers like the Attorney General. These official interpretations can be \u201cprecedents\u201d that political leaders feel obliged to obey. When these precedents contain detailed reasons, then they are called \u201cdoctrine.\u201d The doctrine is sometimes regarded as just as much part of the constitution as its\ntext. Some hidden rules are not officially recognized as doctrine: They are more like \u201cqian guise\u201d \u2013 customs that people follow even though they do not admit it. To know the real constitution rather than just the paper constitution, it is important to be familiar with both basic Page 2 of 14 unwritten principles, official doctrine and qian guise. \nSecond, the written Constitution in the United States is very old and very hard to change through the formal amendment process contained in the Constitution\u2019s text (that is, Article V). The actual Constitution, therefore, gets updated not so much through formal written amendments as through big political fights. These changes take place over a long period of American history. To understand how the Constitution has changed in the past and might change in the future, it is important to be familiar with this history. We will, therefore, spend a lot of time\ndiscussing the basic principles and political fights that have shaped the Constitution\u2019s real meaning.\n In addition to trying to figure out what American law is, we will also spend some time thinking about what constitutional law should be. The People\u2019s Republic of China provides a good opportunity for thinking about whether and to what extent constitutional practices from one society can and should be used in another society. The Fourth Plenum of the Eighteenth People\u2019s Congress announced a new commitment to rule according to the 1982 Constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Would any American ideas help with this commitment, or not?\nComparing the American with the Chinese experience can be a good way of understanding both better.\n This class also presents an opportunity to practice forensic and expository English. That is a fancy way of saying that I want you to get better at describing, and arguing about, law in spoken and written English. We will hold three in-class debates on whether the PRC should adopt, modify, or reject American practices on three specific constitutional topics: Judicial review, executive power, and subnational (\u201cstate\u201d in the United States, \u201cprovincial\u201d in China) power. For the purposes of these debates, the class will be divided into two \u201cteams,\u201d one for\nand the other against the Chinese adoption of an American idea. In addition, everyone must write three short (750-1,000 word) essays attacking or defending three American positions. Of course, to attack or defend an idea, you have to describe it accurately: Part of the mission of your papers and spoken presentations is not only to argue about the law effectively, but also to describe the law clearly.\n\n      less description for SOCS-SHU  172 \u00ab",

Globalization appears to be one of the major reasons to contributing the ever higher incomes of the top 1% in the U.S., for example, even as it lifts hundreds of millions of workers in Asia out of poverty. The overarching goals of this course are that students learn about poverty and inequality in both the poor and rich countries and why it matters to everyone. Students will learn the ways in which poverty and inequality around the globe are shaped by multifaceted contexts; understand the ways how the rich countries (i.e., US and UK) address their own poverty and inequality issues and how the major social policies and programs may affect people\u2019s well-being or quality of life; and develop beginning expertise in understanding social policy content, policy actions of agencies, and political bodies,and the skills needed to influence social policy. This course is particularly concerned with philosophies of global justice and the ethics of global citizenship. Students are expected to critically reflect upon their own engagements with poverty action and their own aspirations for social change. This course emphasizes the roles that social issues, values, power, politics, the economy, discrimination, and advocacy play in the dynamic policy making and implementation environment. This course thus provides students with the basic policy related competencies and practice skills for conducting research-informed policy analysis and advocating for policy change.\n \nThere are no prerequisites for the class although students should be prepared to tackle advanced social science readings and analysis.\n\n      less description for SOCS-SHU  226 \u00ab",
