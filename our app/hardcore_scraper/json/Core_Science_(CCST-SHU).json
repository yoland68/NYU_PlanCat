This course uses nuclear physics as a prism for exploring science as a human endeavor, focusing on the physics of the atomic nucleus and its technological applications. Arguments for and against nuclear power plants are analyzed, while the power and threat of nuclear weapons are assessed. The international treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons are scrutinized, emphasizing the challenges that lawmakers and citizens face in determining and guiding the uses of nuclear power as we grapple with the moral responsibility that all of us\u2014scientists, politicians, and citizens\u2014must bear for ourselves, our nations, and ultimately, for humanity.

This course will explore the development of several human made networks beginning with these early trade routes. Further consideration will be given to the construction of transcontinental railways, the development of electrical telegraph and telephone systems, in addition to the evolution of modern digital communication platforms such as the world wide web. The cultural conditions that encouraged the emergence of these networks, as well as the social outcomes resulting from their adoption, will both be explored through readings and critical dialog. Students will become familiar with: economic principles; network theories and topologies; the development and standardization of protocols; methods for encoding information; concerns about infrastructure, logistics, and security; as well as legislation governing information ownership, privacy, and censorship. Students will also be asked to consider the future of networks as it relates to themes such as crowd-sourcing, software-defined networks, and the Internet of Things.

Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization.

First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.\n\n      less description for CCST-SHU  129 \u00ab",

Moreover, genetic data may be useful to trace migrations and demographic movements. Finally, the reconstruction of ancient diets can provide valuable information on the economic activities of ancient societies. The course will provide a broad-gauged introduction to the historical application of a variety of scientific data, with a special focus on Chinese and Central Asian history.\nCourse requirements\n Students are asked to prepare a short position paper and a class presentation during term time.  Presentation may be prepared in groups or individually. The Mid-Term and Final exams will consist of four multiple choice essays related to the material presented in the course.
