Today\u2019s consumers are as likely to discover content of interest through a Twitter link or in their Facebook feed as they are through a more traditional media outlet. Furthermore, there is a blurring of editorial and advertising lines in a manner that both excites and concerns the industry. The old standards of quality, reliability and relevance are shifting as marketers create content that is highly compelling to consumers. Has the source of the content become less important to consumers? Is content marketing an effective tool\u2026.or a deterioration of standards?  In this course, you will examine both sides of the issue. In addition, you will study the evolution of  content marketing and its role as a tool that not only dates back decades but points the way forward to new creative opportunities for authors, journalists, editors and other publishing experts. We\u2019ll discover how publishers\u2014the original content marketers\u2014can better use their own material to grow both audiences and revenue at a time when traditional marketing practices in publishing are declining in effectiveness. And we\u2019ll discover the power of social media to drive a strong content marketing campaign. Each class session (with the exception of the final class, which will be devoted to student presentations) will consist of three parts: an instructor-led discussion of a particular aspect of content marketing OR a relevant guest speaker presentation and Q&A, student-led discussion of content marketing tactics \u201cin the wild,\u201d and group work on a content marketing initiative selected and produced by the class.\n\n      less description for PUBB1-GC 3075 \u00ab",
