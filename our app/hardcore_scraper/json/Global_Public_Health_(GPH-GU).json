The application of the ethical principles of Beneficence, Respect for Autonomy, and Justice will serve as the foundation for ethical reflection in this course. Aspects of social justice relevant in the international community will be studies, particularly applied to issues surround HIV, stem cell research, human rights, corporate conduct, and the conduct of clinical trials in developing countries. A case study approach will be used throughout the course to explore and elaborate these issues. Texts, movies, and readings will be studied to gain an understanding of global issues that influence public health principles and practice.  Issues will be explored in a general manner that will apply to later reflection in concentration course work and in the integrated seminars. The course endeavors to be a vehicle which deepens understanding and expands individual student?s perspectives about the impact of public health and public health policy. Time will be devoted to exploring issues of man-made and natural catastrophes as a public health issue.

This first part of global environmental health reviews the determinants of health as they relate to the critical substrates of nutrition, water, and air.  Healthy populations have a sufficient, uncontaminated source of each of these substrates.  We will examine contemporary health issues to reveal how deficiencies, excesses, or contamination of water, food, and air may result in disease.

This course will address special topics in cross-cultural health communications including socio-economic, geographical, ethnic, literacy, age, population and gender factors that influence the way health information is understood and accepted as well as people?s behavior and attitudes toward health problems and their potential solutions.  The course will also provide an overview of the field of health communication, and its current issues, theoretical frameworks and trends.  Special emphasis will be placed on specific communication areas (including community mobilization and constituency relations), global health threats (such HIV/AIDS, obesity), communication in emergency situations, and key issues (such as health literacy, health equity and the emergence of e-health).  All topics will be discussed within a multidisciplinary and participatory model for strategic health communications.  Case studies, mini-lectures, guest speakers, videos, on-line resources, examples of communication channels and vehicles, and student-facilitated discussions will be used to illustrate and discuss all topics.\n\n      less description for GPH-GU 2220 \u00ab",

In spite of differences in the organization and financing of their health care systems, most countries share a number of common problems with the United States. First, is the question of deciding - or not explicitly deciding - what proportion of GNP should be devoted to health and welfare. Second, is the problem of agreeing on appropriate criteria to allocate health and social service expenditures. Third, is the problem of how to implement established policies: through regulation, promotion of competition, budgeting, or reimbursement incentives directed at health care providers.  In this class, students will be asked to become \"experts\" about a health system of their choice outside the United States but in a nation belonging to the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Students with a special interest in developing nations and the transitional economies of Central and Eastern Europe may choose to become an expert in a second health system, as well, but all students must choose one relatively wealthy nation that they can compare to the United States. We will examine a range of health systems with respect to their own published data, as well as data collected and analyses conducted by international organizations, e.g. the World Health Organization (WHO), OECD, the World Bank, and UNICEF. The readings, lectures and class discussions will focus on the common problems and themes noted above as they affect the organization and financing of health systems in wealthy OECD nations. We begin with a discussion of the impact of globalization on health system development and an overview of health system models around the world. Second, we examine conceptual frameworks and methods for health systems analysis, and a range of myths about health systems with universal coverage. Third, and this is the heart of the class, we apply these approaches to the empirical analysis of health systems in selected nations and examine the extent to which the available evidence supports or refutes these myths.

Economic and political reforms designed to promote markets, manage competition, organize systems for public contracting, improve management, and change financial incentives in the health sector have been debated in most countries, and in many cases, implemented. While health system reform has received more attention than public health, there has also been increasing attention to what is often termed the \u201cnew public health.\u201d As reforms to improve population health have been added to the political agenda, there have been new efforts to rekindle health reform. \n\nIn this seminar, we will apply some perspectives and tools of public policy analysis, and draw on international comparisons of health systems to analyze efforts at health system and public health reform. The readings, lectures and class discussions should make students more knowledgeable about policy options and policy changes in different countries. The seminar opens with an overview of how forces of \u201cglobalization\u201d may affect health system reform. Next, we focus on ideas, concepts and theories of health care reform. We then attempt to go beyond the OECD and controversial WHO approach to health system performance and examine what may be learned in the United States from health systems and reform efforts in wealthy industrialized nations. The course provides a special focus on the experience of Britain, Germany and France. Each case will apply a common, general framework for analyzing health systems and reform while emphasizing different perspectives for approaching these topics. Students are required to select a wealthy OECD nation and become \u201cexperts\u201d about the health system and efforts to reform it.\n\n      less description for GPH-GU 2353 \u00ab",

Part of the core curriculum of the Masters program in Global Public Health, it provides students with both a critical learning experience and an opportunity to perform a public service.    Over the course of an academic year, students work in teams -- either to address challenges, solve problems and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.  Ultimately, Capstone contributes not only to the students? education, but is a university resource for the public good.  In architecture, the capstone is the crowning piece of an arch, the center stone that holds the arch together, giving it shape and strength.  MPGPH?s Capstone program plays a similar role, by integrating and enhancing student learning in several different arenas: a content or issue area, key process skills including project management and teamwork, and methods for gathering, analyzing and reporting data.  Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex real world environment.  Although each student will be assigned to a team, the class will work as a learning community dedicated to the success of all the projects.\n\n      less description for GPH-GU 2622 \u00ab",

Using the perspectives of the population and community, the course will cover factors associated with the development of environmental health problems. Students will gain an understanding of the interaction of individuals and communities with the environment, the potential impact on health of environmental agents, and specific applications of concepts of environmental health. The course will consist of a series of lectures and will cover principles derived from core environmental health disciplines. The sequence of major topics begins with background material and \"tools of the trade\" (i.e., environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology). The course then covers human activities that lead to exposures to agents of environmental diseases, including chemical, physical, and microbial agents that originate in the environment and can impact human health.\n\n      less description for GPH-GU 5153 \u00ab",
