Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with \u201creal\u201d explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren\u2019t \u201cgenuinely explanatory.\u201d To what extent is this true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction or mathematical derivation? Can false theories provide good explanations? Some familiarity with science would be helpful but is not required.\n\n      less description for PHIL-AD  244 \u00ab",
