The academic debate reflects this uncertainty, with contending theories about what constitutes power in the post cold war environment, how to identify the basic units of international affairs, the nature of globalization, the utility and legitimacy of the use of force, the dynamics of the balance of power, the nature of threats to peace and stability, and the role of international institutions.  This course will examine alternative theories and frameworks for understanding post cold war developments, and test these theories against emergent reality.  How, for example, do these contending theories explain the origins and consequences of terrorism and other global threats?  What importance do they assign to the persistence of poverty and global inequality; to internal ethno/religious conflict and political instability; to 'globalization and its discontents'?  How do these theories assess the potential and implications of renewed great power conflict?  How do they address the problem of U.S. hegemony and the reaction of others (states and non-states) to this new reality?\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 1000 \u00ab",

This course considers a wide diversity of negotiation styles, such as informal as well as formal negotiations, ranging from Cold War superpower bargaining to multilateral standing conferences to extended negotiation processes involving states, NGOs, and third-party facilitators and brokers.  The course also highlights several approaches to conflict resolution and peacemaking formulated by leading scholars with special emphasis on negotiation, mediation and other relevant aspects.  Based on an introductory survey of current theoretical approaches to negotiation and peacemaking, a concerted effort will be made to examine in some detail a number of carefully selected cases and extract relevant lessons for a deeper understanding of these methods of dealing with tensions and violent conflicts in the modern world.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 1010 \u00ab",

The goal of the course is to give students a better understanding of the world economy, the nature of international economic issues, the roles of international economic institutions and multinational enterprises, and the policy challenges of economic interdependence. The first part of the course is intended to provide an interdisciplinary analytical framework for the subject incorporating political science, economics, and recent history. The remaining parts of the course use this analytical framework to examine contemporary issues of international economic relations. These issues are organized under the headings of globalization, economic development, and managing economic interdependence.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 1030 \u00ab",

Its complex history, vast landscape, diverse ethnic, linguistic and religious populations, and contemporary geopolitical importance make it an area of the world that is both complex and critical to understand and appreciate.  The region of Central Asia in the context of this course refers to the five states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  The region is especially important at this juncture in history due to its rich natural resource base, fragile political and economic situation following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the region?s location in relation to its closest neighbors, Russia and China.  Since 1991, many governments, non-governmental organizations and investors have actively tried to engage the region through international development assistance around the support for democratic institution building and most critically, in and around the direction of energy supply and security.  \n\nThe year 1991 was pivotal in that it officially severed the relationship between Moscow and the republics that comprised what was the Soviet Union.  Since then, the region is engaged in a difficult process of transition, renewal, and redefinition.  It is vital in this connection to consider the ?historical residue? in Central Asia, where centuries of migrations, colonization, and war have created a unique ethnic, religious and cultural mix of peoples and ideologies. \n\nThis special seminar introduces students to the region of Central Asia with a brief historical overview and a look at each of the five states, and then moves towards developing a more in-depth look at the energy sector with specific attention to the energy rich Caspian and its key player, Kazakhstan.  The geopolitical positioning of the region, and the engagement of three great powers, China, the United States and Russia, is also examined.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 1125 \u00ab",

Theoretical tools designed to help us interpret events, prescribe policies and anticipate trends are essential intellectual equipment.  They can also become part of the problem, creating a false sense of confidence in how we understand global dynamics.  Can we calibrate our actions to a desired effect?  When at the service of great power, an exaggerated sense of understanding and control can produce massive unintended consequences. Policy is constantly playing catch up, scrambling to right itself in the aftermath of the latest shock. This course accepts uncertainty and surprise as givens, and then proceeds to build alternate scenarios around emerging forces for change and potential `wild card? events. The purpose is not prediction, but a fuller understanding of global dynamics, and of plausible international systems that might emerge. In doing so, we will address theories, sources, indicators and consequences of change, and interactively build alternate future scenarios with students, other interested faculty and outside experts.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 2045 \u00ab",

Long, qualitative reports, while still in use, are losing their utility as global events accelerate in speed; decision-makers, confronted with stacks of reports, usually wind up reading none and craft their policy reactively, as opposed to proactively.\nThe best future policy-makers will hold visual language skills in order to package their information in a format that resonates with end-users. This requires an understanding not only of the issues at stake, but of the tools and techniques to present these issues quickly, concisely and memorably. This course is designed to help students take research into a visual framework in order to facilitate better policy planning. It is designed to be offered in tandem with other courses on Futures and Foreign Policy work and is meant to give students a basic working knowledge of how to present complex information in new 21st century formats.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 2291 \u00ab",

Governance has an important impact on the distribution of resources and public power between women and men.  In addition, gendered power relations shape approaches to governance.

This course will probe that assumption, focusing on how some of the world\u2019s great religious traditions have influenced and been influenced by global political, economic, and social changes in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  The course will address such topics as: religion and nationalism, religious militancy, global and local religious identities, and the politics of religious synchretism and religious orthodoxy.

The reach of the threat defies conventional notions of jurisdiction of sovereign nations, thus making the targeting of cybercriminals particularly challenging for authorities worldwide. This course seeks to enter into the complex world of cybercrime by exploring its evolution and critically evaluating the foreign and domestic measures enacted to fight cybercrime. It further explores public and private investigations of cybercrimes, the problems associated with the prosecution of cybercriminals, and the efficacy of policing the internet. Some crimes covered in this course include (but are not limited to): the online sale of illicit drugs, online sex trade, cyberprostitution, child pornography, electronic espionage, trade secret theft, hacking, malicious software distribution, and cyberterrorism.

While the cluster approach has increased the predictability and accountability of the international response to humanitarian emergencies, the course will discuss a number of cases in which the cluster approach has been applied in order to asses the challenges that still face the international community as it seeks to alleviate the effects of humanitarian emergencies.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 2575 \u00ab",

Understanding the new global order without attempting to understand and account for China is impossible.  China is changing rapidly, asserting itself on the world stage, buying itself into Africa and possibly offering the world a new model of development assistance, expanding its spheres of influence and will undoubtedly continue to increase its impact globally.   We believe that in order to provide our students with the best possible opportunity to understand China, it is necessary to travel there and engage not only with China?s economic, political and social changes but also to interact with leaders in the different spheres.  The program aims to harness transitions facing China today and articulate to students the dynamism and strategic realities and dilemma facing decision-makers today.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 3000 \u00ab",

In Ghana, more than a third of the people live in poverty, despite a decade of democratic rule and nearly a quarter century since economic reform began. In this course, we will examine multiple dimensions of development ? economic, political, environmental, social, cultural and regional ? through the example of Ghana. \n\nAs the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to gain independence from colonial rule, Ghana played a major role in the transformation of the continent. Despite its early promise, the country has endured political upheaval, military rule and economic collapse, as have many in the region. Today, its market liberalization, democratic transition and political leadership put it in the forefront of what many hope will be an African renaissance. These are among the reasons that a case study of Ghana will fortify a broader look at development in Africa. \n\nThe course will be organized in two segments: three sessions in New York before departure for Accra, and 10 days of talks and field visits in Ghana. Pre-departure sessions will provide students with an overview of development issues, a review of African history and political evolution, and an introduction to Ghana?s history, politics, economy and culture. The sessions will include talks by scholars and practitioners. In Ghana, sessions will go into depth on major dimensions of the country?s development, including political, social and environmental as well as economic. We will learn from talks by political and business leaders, scholars, and representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. We also will visit development projects and other sites in the field.\n\n      less description for GLOB1-GC 3010 \u00ab",
