This course also prepares students for Diversity, Racism, Oppression, and Privilege and the integrated Social Work Practice/Field Instruction courses beginning in January. The course will first examine the history of social work practice in the context of the present, explore implications of different theoretical and practice models with particular attention to person-in-environment, and the critical aspects of the helping relationship which is primary to promoting growth and change.

A systems perspective reveals persistent disproportional outcomes on all measures of quality of life int he United States.  From wealth accumulation to health care; from incarceration rates to employment and unemployment, from immigration policy to the opposition of ethnic studies, dramatic ethnic and racial disparities continue to vex the nation.  Form a personal perspective, racial prejudice and invective permeate the civil society. While respect for human diversity in its many forms, and social justice are core values of the profession of social work, this course specifically focuses on the impact of institutional racism, social and economic injustices that impact people of color in health and human services. Social workers interface with clients of color in virtually all practice settings, and have the highest visibility amongst clinical disciplines s in the mental health system.  Therefore, an understanding of the dynamics of race and racism is an essential requirement if we are to \"do no harm\" and engage clients in effective therapeutic alliances.  The course introduced students to the many dimensions of race and racism that influence service outcomes, and implications for direct practice in agency-based settings with clients of color. The course explores and describes the phenomenon of structural racism as fundamental to the construct of the Untied States and how it can be undone.  Using the principles taught in the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond workshop, the course examines the history of racism in the Unites States and current manifestations in health and human services delivery systems with emphasis on the mental health system and implications for direct social work practice.\n\n      less description for MSWEL-GS 2078 \u00ab",

Within each nation where domestic violence is prosecuted, there is debate about whether a criminal-court approach will ever make more than a marginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and interdisciplinary context, is the focus of the weekly seminar. Specific areas of inquiry will include mandatory arrest, prosecutorial discretion, no-drop policies, and mandatory reporting to law enforcement by health care providers. The main points of comparison will be India and the United States. The Comparative Criminal Justice Seminar offered by the Law School is open to SSW and law students. It offers the opportunity (1) to compare and contrast different nations= use of criminal prosecution to combat domestic violence and (2) to develop a critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of different criminal justice strategies. There are no pre-requisites, but students will find it helpful to have academic training or practical experience in one or more of the following areas: domestic violence counseling, policy work, or litigation; criminal law or criminal procedure; comparative or international law or policy; and interdisciplinary work.
