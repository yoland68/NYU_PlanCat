We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry.

We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.\n\n      less description for VISAR-AD  126 \u00ab",

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to \u201cread\u201d and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.\n\n      less description for VISAR-AD  201 \u00ab",
