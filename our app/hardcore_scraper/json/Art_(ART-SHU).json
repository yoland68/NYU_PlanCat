This traditional Chinese art form provides a new way of capturing the city by using Chinese ink to create impressions of solid objects.\n\nIn the studio, students are required to critique the works of peers, works of their own, and images sourced from current exhibitions of contemporary photography.  \n\nOutside the studio, the group will examine major historical movements in contemporary photography. The works of iconic photographers who explored the city as reality and idea are selected to provide framework and vocabulary to articulate students\u2019 own photographic investigations.  \n\nStudents will take on personal projects using photography, ink impression, or a combination of both media.\n\nThis course leads students to use photography as an art tool to explore cultures and individual expression, emphasizing concepts of art while touching on some technical aspects of photography.\n\nThis unit is subject to adjustments depending on the availability of guest speakers and other factors.\n\n      less description for ART-SHU  380 \u00ab",
