The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest, violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.\n\n      less description for PEACE-AD  101 \u00ab",

In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.\n\n      less description for PEACE-AD  120 \u00ab",
