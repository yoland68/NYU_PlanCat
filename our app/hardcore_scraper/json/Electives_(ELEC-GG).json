Dis/ability (as it is written in the field) studies argues that ?disability? is a socially-constructed set of restrictions placed on particular bodies or mentalities. Further, it suggests that all persons have experienced dis/ability as infants and will do so again (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in their lives. One way of understanding these concepts is to look at the extensive presence of people with dis/abilities in art, media and philosophy as both makers and subjects.  This seminar class will be a joint exploration of the necessarily connected experience and representation of dis/ability, embodiment and the 'normal' in modern Western culture. It centers on questions of dis/ability in the three fields at three critical interfaces, namely the formation of Western rationality in the seventeenth century; the generalization and medicalization of the concept of the ?normal? in the nineteenth century; and the emergence of dis/ability as a new form of identity in the past forty years.  Assessment will be based on participation and the development of a project related to one or more of the areas studied, whether practice-based or critical, by arrangement with the instructor.  The class will be wheelchair accessible.   Readings include Lennard Davis, The Disability Studies Reader; Helen Keller, The Story of My Life; Longmore and Umanksy, The New Disability History; Descartes, Discourse on Method.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2433 \u00ab",

The next set of assignments encourage you to work against the grain of the familiar to discover other solutions than the ones that might immediately appear to be the best ones. Towards the end of the terms, these various insights will be channeled into writing about your work that will be useful in the future context of an artist\u2019s statement or project proposal essay.  In the personal and lab-like atmosphere that this course hopes to cultivate, the class aims to connect Gallatin graduate students to each other\u2019s work and practice, and to take advantage of the enormous importance that peer input can have on work in progress. Possible side effects include: getting unstuck, reengagement, enhanced motivation, collaboration.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2435 \u00ab",

Readings will include many contemporary masters of the forms, including Joan Didion and George Saunders, although most of the texts discussed will be student work, via submissions of current projects and also through assignments and in-class exercises.

These are extreme examples of problems all nonfiction writers face.  This nonfiction workshop asks students to try telling the truth in various forms throughout the semester, from memoir to personal essay to literary journalism. All the while, the animating questions will be what it means to tell the truth in these forms and why\u2014or if\u2014telling the truth matters, and whether it is even possible. Is all nonfiction the same? Is any of it ethical? Is, as Janet Malcolm says, the work of a journalist \u201cmorally indefensible?\u201d Weekly workshops will engage ideas from readings by Joan Didion, John McPhee, Leslie Jamison, James Baldwin, John Jeremiah Sullivan, James Agee, Roxanne Gay, among others.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2542 \u00ab",

Each student will create and present to class a work of fiction based on some of the ideas we will be discussing.  The works don\u2019t have to be in the electronic form, but the students will need to explain how they would work.

The rest of the course is devoted to topics such as building ideal ecosystems for astronauts in outer space, efforts to bring space technologies (such as solar cell panels) back to Earth, alternative environmental designs of the counterculture, cyber environments, sick building syndrome, biomimetics, earth art, and other attempts to design with nature. The class will study film and artwork, and include readings by designers such as Walter Gropius, Richard Buckminster Fuller, Ian McHarg, Jon Todd, as well as scientists and commentators such as Julian Huxley,  Eugene Odum, and Stewart Brand.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2622 \u00ab",

The course will try to untangle the relationship between the \u201cspace age\u201d and ecologists\u2019 modeling of the world in terms of a \u201cspaceship\u201d. World gaming and global simulation research, such as in the Limits to Growth report from 1972 will illustrate an emerging environmental ethic of global stewardship that is of relevance to understanding current global warming debates.

In examining the materials used to write media histories\u2014primary and secondary sources, archival records, trade and fan press, promotional materials and social documents\u2014we think about the problems of asserting truth, both on screens and the printed page. We will also consider the particular difficulties and significance of writing the history of popular media, especially given their seductive, if often false, claims to \"reality.\"  Readings will include selections from Lisa Gitelman, Always Already New: Media, History and the Data of Culture; Phillip Rosen, Change Mummified: Cinema, Historicity, Theory; Jon Lewis and Eric Smoodin, Looking Past the Screen: Case Studies in American Film History and Method and E.H.

And how do such meaning-making processes shape the organization of spaces, policies and population within dominant discourses of modernity and development, as well as the emergence of forms of resistance to these economic imaginaries and practices.  We will analyze the \u2018cultural political economy\u2019 problem, or culture and society, within four possible analytical frameworks: social science methodology; everyday life; culture and human rights; and state theory.

It encourages them to grapple with the methodological differences among such broad paradigms as positivism, interpretivism, and poststructuralism, and to try out ideas and methods from each.

For almost seven decades following World War II the United States and the industrialized Western World experienced unprecedented economic growth and geopolitical dominance. The Cold War, a period of superpower nuclear threat, tuned out unexpectedly to be a period of relative global security. The primary leader and beneficiary of the Cold War was the United States. More recently new and unforeseen eruptions of violence and major geopolitical clashes have caused threats to political stability. Mounting crises in American and European economies have brought about economic downturn, disruption and austerity, also threatening world economies. Conservative forces have reasserted their influence in American society and reignited the Culture Wars of the last four decades; American society and the world order are in radical flux.

Moreover, members will conduct pilot-level research using methods appropriate to their problematics: e.g., ethnographic observations, interviews, discourse analysis, document study, visual anthropology, psychometric tests, and/or case studies.  The course will be a useful preliminary for students expecting to do a research thesis focused on questions about the social world.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2740 \u00ab",

Then, as an extended case study, we will explore how photographs, speeches, architecture, murals, guidebooks and even material projects of the New Deal in the United States might suggest an alternative model of propaganda. Finally, we will use what we have learned to sketch out a set of principles for democratic mass persuasion. Authors, artists, and sites we will look at include Plato, Aristotle, Susan Sontag, Stuart Ewen, Walter Lippmann, Lizabeth Cohen, Michael Denning, Michael Schudson, Lawrence Levine, Alan Trachtenberg, Leni Riefenstahl, Joseph Goebbels, Edward Bernays, Lewis Hine, Dorothea Lange, Pare Lorentz, Woody Guthrie, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Timberline Lodge, Bonneville Dam, and Coit Tower.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2745 \u00ab",

Transitional justice has brought a transformation in international human rights law over the last two decades.  While born in the post-World war II Nuremberg trials the field gained momentum in the early nineties when, within a five year period, truth commissions were established in countries such as Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and South Africa; international tribunals were launched to address war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda.  These initiatives were often accompanied by reparation policies for \u2018victims\u2019.  Memorials were built to honor the dead, and reform proposals were enacted under the global mantra of \u2018nunca mas\u2019 or never again. This class examines the enabling conditions and (intended and unintended) consequences of this turn to transitional justice.   We will look at what is at stake in different understandings of accountability and what kind of global subjects are constituted in transitional justice engagements.  Reading some of the most important critical interventions of the last decade, the class will collectively analyze the normative and strategic questions regarding how different approaches negotiate, challenge or legitimize different  actors, institutions and alternative imaginings of 'justice'.   The course is open to graduate students; advanced undergraduates are permitted with the permission of the instructor.  There is a lot of reading for the course (10 books) \u2013 virtually a book a week for most weeks\u2013 so those interested should be able to manage that reading load.   This is not a survey course that provides an overview of transitional justice norms, laws and institutions.  Rather, it seeks to analyze the transitional justice field through engagements with theorists from multiple disciplines, including international law, political theory, history and anthropology.   Readings include Hannah Arendt, Kamari Clark, Ruti Teitel, Rosalind Shaw and others.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2750 \u00ab",

What are the social and cultural elements that constitute life as ordinary reality? Study of everyday life is a highly powerful representation of how physical public space can be infused with the full richness and ambiguity of the imaginary\u2014in a material context where the future path of a society is being decided through people\u2019s \u2018innocuous\u2019 everyday actions (gathering to drink tea or coffee, playing music, or going shopping).  A \u2018lifestyle\u2019 expresses a political allegiance, however murkily and grainily understood.  It is \u2018below\u2019 the level of rational discourse, in imaginatively infused habitus. We will particularly focus on the variety of everyday practices in post-revolutionary Iran under the Islamic Republic. The class starts with a brief section on the social and cultural history of modern Iran and studies important scholarly works on the Iranian Revolution of 1979. We will also examine the social and cultural changes taking place in Iran over the past three decades. Most of the course will focus on various forms of everyday life practices in Iran. Some areas of everyday life we will examine are: consumption and life style; youth and underground culture; love and sexual experiences; public and private sphere; new and old religiosity; leisure time and secularization of time; and war as an ideological practice.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2755 \u00ab",

Drawing on a growing body of both scholarly research and grassroots resources, we will explore interdisciplinary frameworks for critically examining the relationships, implications and utilities of mass incarceration.  Students will collaborate on a final project analyzing a specific aspect of the 'prison industrial complex' and assessing proposed solutions. To encourage innovative approaches to research, and to link scholarship to lived experiences of incarceration, students will prepare group presentations, and have opportunities to organize and participate in correctional facility visits, performances, screenings, discussions, and arts-based workshops with formerly and currently incarcerated artists and prison activists.

This course steps back and offers a broader perspective, by introducing students to the critical analysis of non-governmental organizations and their role in shaping global institutions and domestic political and social change.   It locates NGOs within the web of transnational assemblages that they operate in, and pays attention to the experiences and practices of \u201clocal\u201d populations that fall in and out of the category of \u201cclient.\u201d   We draw from a range of literatures to inform our analysis: democratic theory around citizenship and civil society; theories of the state; critical studies of development; and analyses of social movements, institutions and global networks.  We focus on a few emblematic cases of transnational NGOs and their consequences, including Human Rights, Fair Trade, and alter-globalization NGOs.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2765 \u00ab",

Dancers in these scenes are often referred to as obsessed, addicted, and out of control. But whose control? In this course we examine the relation of the moving body to music and transgression, analyzing the way aesthetic styles create demimondes and subcultures that transform gender relations and public affect writ large. Beginning with theories of the aesthetic that explain the power of the body in cultural expression, we move on to examine dance worlds in their historical and ethnographic context, paying close attention to the politics of the body and its influence on changing parameters of social permissibility. We will also explore dancers\u2019 efforts to test behaviors and assert identities outside the confines of the ordered, everyday world and consider what qualities are lost or gained when these dances become adopted for mainstream consumption.  We will read works by Pierre Bourdieu, Marcel Mauss, Jacques Ranciere, Jose Munoz, Jane Desmond, Sarah Thornton, Fiona Buckland, Robert Farris Thompson, Julie Taylor, Juliet McMains, Frances Aparicio,  Marta Savigliano, Barbara Browning, and Tricia Rose, among others.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2770 \u00ab",

Athenian State Theater developed a dramatic form -- tragedy -- that paid its dues both to epic and to ritual, and formalized a space for exploring the complex relations of kinship, eros, gender, the polis, thought and desire.  This course grounds itself in ancient Greek tragedy and pursues its afterlives and aftershocks in the early modern and modern periods, in drama, philosophy, and film.  Tragedy was never without its others\u2014its accompanying satyr play, comedy, philosophy: Euripides in particular is among the most influential explorers and exploders of the genre, and the course will take a special look at his role in shaping early modern ideas of tragedy and tragicomedy.  Throughout we will attend to historical situation, rhetorical resources, genre as category, and questions of the mediation of the tragic in later periods. As a space for our own speculations about the intersections of theory and drama, the course will include readings from Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, Shakespeare, Racine and Beckett, and will give some attention to modern film interpretations of works by these playwrights, including Pasolini\u2019s Medea, Kozintsev\u2019s King Lear, and Kurosawa\u2019s Ran; theoretical readings will include Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Vernant, and Butler. The idea of \u201cThinking with Tragedy\u201d is to build in a space for uncovering the exfoliations of tragedy into other genres and forms, and for speculation on the generative power of tragedy for aesthetic theory.\n\n      less description for ELEC-GG 2830 \u00ab",
