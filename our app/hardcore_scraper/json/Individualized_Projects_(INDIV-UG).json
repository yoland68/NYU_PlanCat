Private lessons may be taken in voice, music, dance, acting, and the visual arts, with teachers or studios of their choice--as long as they have met with the approval of the Gallatin faculty. Credit for private lessons is determined by the number of instruction hours per semester. Students taking private lessons are required to submit a journal and final assessment paper to the faculty adviser. Unlike private lessons offered elsewhere in the University, Gallatin's private lessons are arranged and paid for by the student. The student is responsible for full payment to the studio or instructor for the cost of the private lessons, as well as to NYU, for the tuition expenses incurred by the number of private lessons course credits.\n\n      less description for INDIV-UG 1701 \u00ab",

Gallatin provides an extensive list of available internships; students may pursue their own as well.

Students work anywhere from 8 to 24 hours each week; for each credit, students are expected to devote three to four hours per week during the fall and spring semesters, and at least seven to nine hours per week during the six-week summer sessions.  Students may receive credit for either of two forms of the Internship: one for a letter grade, and one for a pass/fail grade.  (Students may of course engage in non-credit internships, for which they may get assistance through the Wasserman Center.)  Students wishing to earn a letter grade will register for K50.1802 and attend a biweekly, 75-minute seminar in which they will process the learning experience intensively, examining such issues as the history and organization of their work sites; the dynamics of power and social identity (race, gender, class, etc.); the nature of knowledge-use and action in the setting; the relationship between the organization and its larger environment, and so on.  In seminar discussions with interns in other sites, they will discuss comparisons and contrasts across settings, as well as conceptual approaches to understanding real-world experience.  Students wishing to earn a pass/fail grade will register for K50.1801 and attend two workshops about internships; keep a journal of their daily internship experiences; submit a progress report describing the internship; and write a final paper for the faculty adviser.  They may meet occasionally with the adviser to discuss the work and their learning.\n\n      less description for INDIV-UG 1802 \u00ab",

Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing. Independent studies are graded courses, the details of which are formulated by the student and his or her instructor; these specifics are described in the Independent Study proposal and submitted to the Dean's Office for approval. The student and instructor meet regularly throughout the semester to discuss the readings, the research, and the student's work. Credit is determined by the amount of work entailed in the study and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. Generally, independent studies, like other courses, are 2 to 4 credits. Meeting hours correspond to course credits; a 4-credit independent study requires at least seven contact hours per term between the teacher and the student.\n\n      less description for INDIV-UG 1901 \u00ab",
