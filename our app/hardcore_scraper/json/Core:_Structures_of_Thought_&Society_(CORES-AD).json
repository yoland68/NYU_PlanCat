Often the call for tolerance is grounded in relativism\u2014the thought that there isn\u2019t a fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective, a function of upbringing or our peculiar tastes and concerns? But should we accept relativism? Can relativism justify tolerance? If not, then how can we justify tolerance?",

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a \u201cjust war,\u201d as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J. Muste, Johan Galtung, Alma Myrdal, and Petra Kelly, among others.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   27W \u00ab",

The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project.

But the study of slavery inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion, and belonging. As Orlando Patterson put it in the most far-reaching study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death, \u201cthe idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis. Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves.\u201d\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   37W \u00ab",

But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, by finding some particular function of the brain? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called \u201cthe human condition\u201d? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion\u2014or, worse, a deceit.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   48 \u00ab",

Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmak\u012brti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   50 \u00ab",

Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance?  How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   54J \u00ab",

We engage with these and related questions through the prism of related literatures in political science, economics, and history. First, we explore the motivations of colonizing powers and their methods. We then consider the colonial experience from the perspective of populations being colonized. Most of the course is dedicated to exploring the impact of colonial institutions and practices on contemporary levels of development, inequality, and conflict in the former colonies.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   60 \u00ab",

We trace the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day. We explore the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. We discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade; or historically to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. We explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   62 \u00ab",

What is the relationship of internationalism to national and imperial imaginations? 2. Should internationalism be utopian, revolutionary, or reformist? 3. How should equality and justice inform the construction of a multilateral world? 4. What is the place of gender, race, and religion in the development of communities beyond nation-states? 5. Can internationalist projects accommodate differences in cultures, affects, and aesthetics?  Among other authors, our readings will include texts by Immanuel Kant, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, W.E.B.

Although democracy and equality have been deeply linked in the history of political thought, critics of democratic practice argue that formal equality among citizens has rarely prevented substantive economic and political inequalities from arising--inequalities that belie the very democratic character of self-described democratic states.  One of the perennial questions of democratic theory, therefore, has been whether such substantial inequalities play a necessary structural role in democracy or whether democratic societies should strive to eliminate them.  We will begin getting our bearings on this debate by examining one of history\u2019s most radical and influential democracies, ancient Athens.  After reading Thucydides\u2019 complex historical account of democratic Athens at war, we will turn to ancient defenses of and attacks on democracy by Aristophanes, Isocrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  We then will compare these ancient arguments to subsequent ones by Madison, Mill, Marx, Rawls, Przeworski, and Sen in an attempt to appreciate the complex interplay between discourses of equality and inequality in democratic societies, both ancient and modern.  We will also discuss recent arguments for and against \u201cglobal democracy\u201d.  The course concludes by recreating the intellectual dynamics of direct democracy in Athens.  Students will assume roles in key decision making institutions and debate questions about democratic procedures, the extension of voting rights, religion and free speech, democratic foreign policy, etc.\nThis course counts as an International J Term.\n\n      less description for CORES-AD   65J \u00ab",
