The second week will include two exercises -- the creation of a scavenger hunt for the rest of the class, and a structured \"neighborhood walk\" for others to use. The third week will be class discussion of the current state of user-created maps, with attention to future social and economic uses of these tools. The class will culminate with a presentation of these possible futures by each small group.\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU   10J \u00ab",

Students will learn the principles of electronics and programming as they build projects using the Arduino microcontroller platform, a small computer based on open source hardware and software. When used in conjunction with various sensors and actuators, Arduino is capable of gathering information about and acting upon the physical world. In addition to these physical computing techniques, students will also learn to harness the methods of traditional computation for the purposes of self-expression. The fundamentals of programming: variables, conditionals, iteration, functions and objects, will be explored first through the use of JavaScript, an approachable scripting language most commonly associated with the Web, and later by using the Java based Processing language. Students will gain a deeper appreciation of the expressive possibilities of computation as they learn to author their own software, and not simply use that which is provided to them. Additional topics will include digital fabrication using 3D printers and laser cutters, the exchange, manipulation, and presentation of data, algorithmic drawing and animation techniques, as well as the synthesis of images, audio, and video. Structured weekly exercises are aimed at building practical skills, however students are encouraged to experiment wildly, and are free to pursue their own diverse interests in their midterm and final projects.\n\nRequired Course (Formerly known as Introduction to Computational Media & Physical Computing)\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU  101 \u00ab",

Examples are: What is the differing link structure of Baike and Wikipedia articles on the same subject? Which Harry Potter characters appear more frequently in Chinese vs. English fiction set in that universe? What are the patters of participation on collaborative writing sites?\n\nThe work of the class is readings, class discussion, group work, and applying new interpretative tools to the selected texts.

In this course, designed for NYU Shanghai Interactive Media Arts majors studying abroad, students will be asked to integrate a variety of collaborative processes and methodologies for sharing into their work. First, by establishing a coauthored or user-generated storytelling environment for the collection and distribution of narratives, either fiction or nonfiction. Next, students will learn to programmatically acquire and aggregate data from a variety of online sources. Official APIs for popular social media outlets will be introduced, and standard methods for data parsing as well as unofficial data scraping techniques will both be employed to create online mashups featuring content from multiple sources. Students will then propose and execute an open content / open source final project that synthesizes the concepts and techniques explored within this course. Readings and discussions will further involve students in debate over related issues, including intellectual property and open data. Students are encouraged to incorporate site specific elements into their projects, and students and their collaborators will be free to use text, audio, video, animation, and transmedia approaches within their work.\nNote: This course is an online distributed course. Registration for this course is limited to IMA Majors studying at the Global Sites. \n(Old Category:Interactive Art & Entertainment / New Category: New Media & Entertainment)\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU  190 \u00ab",

Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.\n\nElective: Arts & Entertainment and Skill Development\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU  212 \u00ab",

And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.\n\n(Prereq: Interaction Lab / Counts as: Design and Skill Development)\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU  234 \u00ab",

This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?\n\nAdding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.\n\n(Old Category: Seminar / New Category: Seminar)\n\n      less description for INTM-SHU  250 \u00ab",
