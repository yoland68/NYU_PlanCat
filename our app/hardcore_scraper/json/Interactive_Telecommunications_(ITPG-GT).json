Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your computational project ideas will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This six week course is divided in two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body & how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard & monitor interface & at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere & sense & actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog & serial input & output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision & 3D graphics. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor & actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 1000 \u00ab",

Interactive media projects and approaches to the design of new media applications are presented weekly; students are thus exposed to both commercial as well as mission-driven applications by the actual designers and creators of these innovative and experimental projects. By way of this process, all first year students, for the first and only time in their ITP experience, are together in one room at one time, and as a community, encounter, and respond to, the challenges posed by the invited guests. The course at once provides an overview of current developments in this emerging field, and asks students to consider many questions about the state of the art. For example, with the new technologies and applications making their way into almost every phase of the economy and rooting themselves in our day to day lives, what can we learn from both the failures and successes? What are the impacts on our society? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space? Class participation, group presentations, and a final paper are required.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2000 \u00ab",

It's not quite what you thought it would be when you made your first rough sketch, there?s even something a little goofy about it, but then there's also that interesting curve that you hadn't envisioned. Your teammates have also noticed some things that you hadn't thought of. You see where you can reshape the foam to make the prototype both look and work better. You've made your first step; you've moved your project forward. Removing barriers to creative problem solving and learning the steps for advancing a project are the dual purposes of this course. You're asked to make things over and over during your time at ITP. This class helps you to break out of 2-d screen and keyboard thinking and take advantage of the discoveries that inevitably occur when you're thinking in 3-d by manipulating materials with your hands, observing the results, and refining successive iterations of your idea. From techniques for prototyping and making small objects to fabrication methods for kiosks, you'll get hands-on experience with a variety of materials and methods. You have an idea for a wearable device? Mock it up with the sewing machine. You're thinking about a squeezable children's toy with sensors? Make a mold and cast some sensors inside soft rubber. You want to build an installation? Make a foam core model of the space and get a valuable preview of your project installed. During the course you'll be introduced to building in a variety of materials. You?ll make objects of wood, foam, plastic, metal, clay, plaster, rubber, paper and fabric. You'll move a project from sketch to prototype to presentation and learn to incorporate the lessons of the process into your final product. By taking notice of the unexpected your original concept will evolve, and amplified by those revelations it will surprise you and delight your audience.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2025 \u00ab",

Music in performance is the primary subject of this class. We approach questions such as \"What is performance?\" \"What makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?\" and \"How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?\" Over the semester, we look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance - such as novice versus virtuoso performers, discrete versus continuous data control, the importance of haptic responsiveness as well as the relationship between musical performance and visual display. Extensive readings and case studies provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance. Students design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. A technical framework for prototyping performance controllers is made available. Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance. The class culminates in a musical performance where students (or invited musicians) will demonstrate their instruments. Prerequisites: H79.2233 (Introduction to Computational Media) and H79.2301 (Physical Computing).\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2227 \u00ab",

The course is designed for computer programming novices. Although experienced coders can waive this class, some programmers use ICM to acclimatize to the ITP approach and for the opportunity play further with their project ideas. Weekly assignments are required throughout semester. The end of the semester is spent developing an idea for a final project and implementing it using computer programming.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2233 \u00ab",

Students should be comfortable programming in at least one language (Processing or PHP preferred), and with the basics of physical computing. Topics of discussion include: networking protocols and network topologies; network time vs. physical time; coping with network unreliability; planning a network of objects (system design); mobile objects; and wireless networks of various sorts. Students undertake a series of short production assignments and final project, and keep an online journal documenting their work and reading. We also do reading and discussion of contemporary work in the field. This course has a lab fee of $201.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2253 \u00ab",

This class covers the design and implementation of the \"dynamic\" website in two distinct but related contexts: the technical aspects of manipulating content \"on the fly\", and the end user experience of interacting in this type of setting. Particular attention is given to social and community-based web interaction. The production environment consists of the MySQL database and the PHP programming language. Students can expect to develop a firm knowledge of database design and optimization, the SQL query language, and the use of PHP to create dynamic activity of both orthodox and unorthodox nature. Late-semester topics focus on interfacing this environment with other technologies such as JavaScript and Flash, along with data population and site architecture methodology. Introduction to Computational Media or equivalent programming experience is required. Students are also expected to have fluency in HTML or to come up to speed with it outside of class. Class requirements include homework assignments to reinforce each week's concepts while simultaneously contributing to the student's \"toolkit\" of code and design principles. There is also a midterm project, and a final project of the student's choosing. Given the wide range of applications that would benefit from a web-accessible database, students should feel free to use their project(s) from this class to support or enhance projects from other classes.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2296 \u00ab",

In exploring this, we touch upon the global economy, demographics, international politics, environmental concerns, and other large-scale issues. Scenario planning is a rigorous but highly engaging technique, in which people share information and judgment to create a picture of the future larger than any individual could produce alone. The technique has been used since the mid-1950s decades to distinguish certainties from uncertainties, and to learn to be prepared for multiple eventualities. Students will conduct original research on significant trends, use those trends to develop compelling, plausible stories about possible futures, and present the futures - and the strategies they suggest - to a public audience. As part of the process that we co-develop, the class explores theories about system dynamics, organizational and societal change, the causes of economic failure and success, and the nature of technology.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2297 \u00ab",

Class time is spent on interface design and software development issues as well. The class explores some interesting capabilities of the software in terms of real-time camera input and tracking, generative graphics systems, and media transcoding. Throughout the class students develop and share ideas on live performance as a medium for visual expression, and learn the software tools necessary to put these ideas into practice in the form of idiosyncratic performance systems. A final presentation in the form of a group performance will be arranged. Students should have some working knowledge of Max/MSP before taking this class.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2422 \u00ab",

Who would be there? What would its main purpose be? Before you answer that question, let?s take a look back. The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside--amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go. The public was very limited; children were usually not allowed in. They were elitist institutions whose mission was archiving the past. Today, although most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors, there are fundamental ways?attitudes, techniques, structural issues?that are still lodged in the 19th century. Now, because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e. the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit... but we do in this course. We document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g. The Tenement Museum) and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers) Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions, discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from school room learning. The class is an exploration, observation and theory class. You are asked to visit specific museums: an iconic one of each type. These visits are your primary assignments?sometimes accompanied by a reading. Someone from the assigned museum comes to class and makes a presentation and receives critiques from you. In the second half of the course, we begin to reinvent the museum. What is its purpose in the 21st century? How does the need for a curator change? We look at different museums? efforts to use technology to take museums beyond the walls, to expand the notion of curators, to include people who don?t have access, or don?t know they do, to the places. And though we focus on museums&we also look at exhibits, and other public displays of information. This is not a design or production class. The assignments are field trips to museums, readings, and writing. The classes are primarily discussion-driven and class participation is the major part of the grade.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2470 \u00ab",

Industrial Designer professionaThe objective of this workshop is to make more beautiful things. Industrial Designer professionals give shape to new technology, creating mass-produced things like trains, cars, appliances, furniture, medical equipment, toys, packaging, corporate identity -- any user interface. The methodology based on scientific problem analysis with a user-centered perspective applies to any media. This integration of problem solving and creative inspiration in the hands of talented people is a very powerful tool, so powerful that Victor Papanek, author of Design for the Real World, says Industrial Design is ?the most dangerous profession.? By building a set of projects that explore materials, processes and aesthetics, you will apply a three phases of design process: 1. explore, 2. sketch, and 3.make. Class critiques focus on improving the product communication and looks, so we can be as good as we can!  Note: This two-point class meets every other Wednesday beginning January 21.  This course has a lab fee of $201.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2474 \u00ab",

What does it mean to use the ?scientific method?? What is the purpose and value of data produced in experiments? How true are representations crafted with data, and who wants or needs to know about scientific results? What do we gain by incorporating scientific data or visualization into our own work? The course focuses on cases from emerging and converging scientific and technological fields: nano, info, & bio. The goal is to cultivate purposeful science communication and to encourage critical responses to scientific and technological practice in modern culture. Over the course of the class, each student focuses on a particular area of science and becomes familiar with its process, language, and data. To do this, we get some first hand experience unpacking particular visualizations, talking with scientists and students of scientific disciplines, and interviewing members of our potential audiences. Who produces and analyses data, what are they looking for in their results? Who else is interested in understanding data --in what setting, through what medium or interface? From these direct experiences, we propose our own art/science collisions: using artistic sensibilities and media tools to communicate about the scientific process, contextualize and annotate visualizations, and frame our chosen topic for particular audiences: museum-goers, policy makers, the disabled, teachers, adults, or children. In periodic ?science salons,? we discuss our chosen areas of science, associated datasets and visualizations, affiliated scientists, and potential audiences. We formulate our own approach to communicating information about science, data, and the topics these inform. Students fully-develop one idea as a media/ interactive presentation for the final project, incorporating scientific data and framing the presentation for a select audience and setting.

The second, related question is, why do we function in groups. Group life is often unpleasant ? it can be frustrating or boring in the extreme, and yet we often chose group membership over individual action when given the choice, whether on Monday morning or Friday night. What are the motivations that lead people to give up enough autonomy to participate in group action, either extrinsic (seeking fame and fortune) or intrinsic (feelings of accomplishment or appreciation of others.) Readings are drawn from classic sociological literature (Emil Durkheim, Mark Granovetter, Robert Axelrod) and from recent observations about mediated groups (danah boyd, Dan Hill, Clay Shirky); course work involves readings, class discussions, observation of existing groups, and three papers discussing the design of group interaction.

Generative Art creates a process of evolution. Where most art imitates life, generative art has a life of its own.  Generative methods have been chained to the personal computer for too long. What would happen if we took the algorithms employed in software art and applied them to the physical world through sensors and reactive elements? Or like Ned Kahn's piece \"wind,\" apply laws of nature to physical works?  In this class we apply simple rules to dictate the shape or function of a work and add to it an inherent complexity that is both beautiful and intelligent. By combining the simple rules, or a system, with physical computing, we are marrying the work to the intention of the artist. This helps us define what we are doing when we create; it takes the assignments beyond exercises in executing basic electronics and drives it to an intention.  Living Art extracts the generative approach from the personal computer and applies it to the physical world. In some cases it is very clear how we can apply the Generative methods in the use of motors or light grids, but how do we apply fuzzy logic? This class is for students who have completed Introduction to Physical Computing. This course has a lab fee of $201.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2534 \u00ab",

We depend most heavily on light to sense the world.  As our experience is increasingly mediated through computers, it is not surprising that cameras have become an integral part of them.  As computers become small, cheap and ubiquitous in laptops, cellphones and microcontrollers the cameras attached to them can gain coverage of every corner of life.   This class looks at the possibilities and the computer software for getting a hold of the signals coming in from all these cameras.  The class first looks getting images, integrating multiple views and transmitting them over a network.  The class then turns to the more demanding programming required to process or analyzed the incoming image for such things as background removal, finding edges, for tracking objects.  As a sensor, the video camera is appealing; delivering up to 36 million bytes every second compared to maybe 3 bytes from a keyboard.  This requires a coding parsimony that can be used as a challenging exercise to improve a students general coding skills but the real difficulty of computer vision comes when you expect your software to be able to mimic the powers of the human brain to interpret arbitrary images.  This class attempts to side step these very difficult parts by working in fairly contrived environments such as art installations, eye tracking rigs, and ant farms.   The course uses Java in the Eclipse environment which is a good next step from the Processing environment.  We look at implementing these techniques across platforms, including the desktop, the cellphone and even on a microcontroller.   The class requires ICM or similar programming background.

Many unconscious cues and actions that are valued in ordinary human expression are ignored or filtered by computer-mediated interactions. Relinquishing a conscious gatekeeper can be associated with such uncomfortable subjects as subliminal manipulation, subconscious repression, even a loss of free will and the insanity defense! On the other hand going past conscious control can be associated with achieving virtuosity in the arts and athletics, acquiring insight into your personality, and engendering trust in conversation. In this course students build on software and hardware tool kits to create hands-on experiments tapping less conscious parts of your experience. The prototyping exercises include using cell phone as personal sensor logger and then visualizing the results; sensing autonomic nervous responses such as heart rate; and trapping and analyzing language use on your computer. Group work is encouraged. The last part of the semester we concentrate on final projects.

The creation and evaluation of work in this class pivots on the notion of narrative perception: a viewer?s desire to actively make story out of represented moments, from Chaplin?s silent movies to US Army recruitment ads to Smithson?s Spiral Jetty. The emphasis of this class is on art practices, focusing on sculptural and screen-based installation forms rather than commercial applications. More conceptual than technical, more narrative than formal, students work on the creation of time-based projects through short and medium-length assignments. Students work in a range of media, from paper maps to multiple screens. In addition, students are expected to engage in critical dialogue through individual research and presentation of precedents, from new media art projects, readings, and experimental or mainstream film. \n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2572 \u00ab",

Yet these concepts are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, the notion of interactivity, frequently observed as original and specific to the user-interaction component of computer-mediated works, was equally, if differently, specific to Gianlorenzo Bernini's 17th-century Baroque sculpture and architecture. Indeed the very concept of new media, and the concomitant implication of critically significant artistic development, applies throughout history. Oil revolutionized painting in the Renaissance, as did house-paint (on canvas) in the 1950s; in the 1910s, the found object indelibly altered definitions of art, the importance of the object being subsumed by that of the concept in the 1960s. This course examines how artists working before the boom of digital technology utilized other media, techniques and approaches to effect formal, conceptual and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The objective of the course is to provide students with not only knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also a platform through which that knowledge might be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. It is the goal that through observation, discussion, reading and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility. Organized thematically, each class focuses on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents. The course focus primarily, though not exclusively, is on 20th/21st-century art. It is conducted as a combination lecture/discussion class. Critical theory is incorporated into the readings and discussions, but this is not strictly a theory course. The course has been conceptualized and designed to enhance understanding through a variety of means, from basic observation, to exploratory conversations, to more rigorous thinking informed by lectures, readings and focused discussions. \n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2586 \u00ab",

This studio is a complement to a production class -- each student brings a project from another class -- we take the time, often lacking in class, to learn how to focus an idea into a workable concept, and to practice and experiment with ways to present it. Writing is critical to thinking and design. So the writing you do helps you hone and clarify your concept and lay the basis for a smoother more effective design and development process. We work on the structure of presentations, public speaking techniques; how to write and design engaging and memorable presentations. We also work on written communication, which may include: grant writing, artist's statements and proposals. \n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2588 \u00ab",

This workshop aims to bring information sources we all care about into the mainstream. Our goal is to explore how selective streams of information can be sited and expressed in a way that not only creates engagement on the part of the viewer, but inspires action. Students work on a two-part semester-long design project based on an information source of their choice. Basic programming or action-script skills are required. The class is conducted as a design studio with bi-monthly critiques. It includes seminar discussions and guest visits by experts in the design profession. All aspects of visual communication are addressed, with an emphasis on typography, layout, color, and motion. Students need not have any formal design training, but should come with a particular interest in and commitment to honing their design skills.

More than art within \"the framework\" of an art institution, site-specific, interactive and community-based works require rigorous levels of observation, interrogation, and participation. Whether in the physical or the virtual public, frame and context are primary considerations in the work you produce. This class is part studio and part refection, using contemporary art examples and writings that engage and critique the local and the global, invert locale and involve the everyday as well as traditional urban studies of observation. The studio portion of the class will either utilize an existent space in New York, or work towards the development of proposals for a fictional grant for lower Manhattan.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2620 \u00ab",

Real-world, professional level components and technologies are also covered in case studies and class examples. From kinetic sculptures to modernThis class is designed to equip the student with a basic knowledge of mechanical engineering, materials, and component selection for practical use. Emphasis is placed on finding and using affordable, everyday components for the hobbyist. Real-world, professional level components and technologies are also covered in case studies and class examples. From kinetic sculptures to modern architecture, from product design to interactive art, learning how to create sound mechanical interfaces between inputs and outputs to a system helps us interpret and interact with our environments. There is little use in building effective circuitry for physical computing if the mechanism to be controlled is too weak to handle the task set forth for it. Systems can also be optimized and protected from expensive over-engineering with a basic knowledge of mechanics and materials. A breadth of topics is covered ranging from how to attach couplers and shafts to a motor to converting between rotary and linear motion. Many topics are presented in the form of competition, challenges, or group installations. Weekly lectures are supplemented by in class demos and out of class lab work. Both Individual and group work is required.  Prerequisite: H79.2301 Introduction to Physical Computing. This course has a lab fee of $201.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2624 \u00ab",

Though clearly a truthful statement about the state of the art, it is also a quality immanent in Nature. Even ephemeral qualities such as ideas are machines, and in the case of humans, one could reasonably argue that the act of drawing is the most powerful replicator of the idea. Without drawing we would not have high art, composed music, written language, architectural plans, far-reaching spacecraft, software, embedded computers, i.e. the entire cultural-technological world as we know it today. From this broad viewpoint as a ground, the class requires the student to actively pursue a critical understanding of their own artistic practice. The student is expected to create many different kinds of drawings whether by hand, by machine, or by computation. Class discussions revolve around this creative output as well as drawing upon the writings of Walter Benjamin, Deleuze & Guattari, Paul Klee, Agnes Martin, Sol Lewitt, Catherine De Zegher, Stephen Wolfram, Jeanne Boylan, Norbert Wiener, and others.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2688 \u00ab",

Basic training is provided in a variety of handy methods for interpretation and manipulation of data, yet no math beyond some simple arithmetic is required for completing this course. Exercises include using sensors to gather data, employing information to answer questions, building physical models and using some very accessible computer tools. Short projects teach how to understand where data comes from, what it looks like and what it means.

By using techniques from animation, special effects, video editing, and programming, we break images apart and reassemble them into new moving imagery. Our primary tool is Adobe After Effects but we also explore the algorithms behind image manipulation so that students might integrate the techniques into their own code. Student?s assignments can either be pre-rendered animation, or real- time/ interactive animation. Grades are based on weekly assignments, a midterm project, and a final project. Class participation and discussion are also required. No previous knowledge of After Effects is necessary, but students should be relatively comfortable with Photoshop. Experience with non- linear editing is a plus, but not required. Students must have completed either one animation class, or one post-ICM programming class.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2716 \u00ab",

What responsibilities do users as \"citizens\" rather than \"customers\" demand of designers? Drawing from my own interest in, research for, and links to, New York City agencies and service providers,  we explore the kinds of relationships that services broker, and practice some key design processes and methods to understand how context of use, stakeholders, storytelling and mapping techniques shape services. In class and through assignments, we review a range of real life case studies in New York and elsewhere.  The class is part seminar and part workshop. It's not a production class; instead, assignments focus on written and sketching exercises, and reading. There are opportunities to present, and, where successful, contribute your work to relevant experts/service providers. You enrich your participation in class discussion, reflect on the work of peers and of guest speakers and have a chance to rehearse your design skills. The main aim is that the materials and exercises that engage you in this class become broadly applicable to other projects (for second years, your thesis), at ITP and beyond.

This class takes an analytical approach to unraveling and understanding these charged moments. In the process of the studying how and why strangers interact in public, we address some of the abiding themes at ITP?urban behavior, spontaneous interaction, the pleasure of the unexpected, how technology can mediate and/or enable human experience?and we make a close and thorough examination of how they play out in this narrow slice of human experience. This approach is designed to bring students to a more concrete understanding of these larger abstract ideas.  Classwork consists of readings, class discussions, field assignments (a series of assigned interactions with strangers that the students will document and discuss) and an analytical final paper. Students learn how the interactions of strangers have changed historically (and why), what the experience of interaction with strangers means to the participants, how strangers 'read' each other, how they initiate interactions, how they avoid interactions, how they trust each other and how they fool each other. Readings range from seminal works on urban sociology and public behavior (Georg Simmel, Stanley Milgram, Erving Goffman, Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, Elijah Anderson) to more lyrical examinations of strangers in cities (Tim Etchells, Italo Calvino, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Edgar Allan Poe) to recent neuropsychiatric discoveries about trust, mimicry, and flash judgments. Because stranger interactions are at heart a means to interrupt the expected narrative of the everyday, we consider the works of artists and thinkers who show how such disruption, surprise, spontaneity, and play are fundamental to the pleasure and substance of urban life, for example: the Situationists and their descendents, Sophie Calle, Marina Abramovic, Francis Alys, Graffiti Research Lab, Robert Rauschenberg, Survival Research Labs. We also explore recent art/technology projects that specifically engage strangers, such as Familiar Strangers, the Listening Station, PostSecret, Oddible, Loca: Set to Discoverable, Following/the Man in the Crowd, Mobile Feelings, and others.

This class critically examines the design of these technologies as they play upon specific human emotions and vulnerabilities. In the spirit of transparency and ethical investigation, we explore approaches to subverting, upending and exposing our relation to such technologies. Furthermore, we examine the power of persuasive technologies in creating opportunities for communicating non-human intentions and viewpoints. Readings range from Douglas Adams on Genuine People Personalities, to Frank Herberts \"Without Me, You're Nothing,\" Friedrich Juenger's \"The Failure of Technology\", to BJ Fogg, Nass and Rives, and the work in Critical Design by Dunne and Raby, among others. ?Through class discussion, readings and examples we identify human emotional/social touchpoints: jealousy, seduction, fear, risk, reward, etc. Students conduct their own analyses of a manipulation technique, and of its corresponding persuasive technology application. For the second assignment students develop and present a persuasive technology concept for a non-human object or viewpoint. An example might be Play Coalition's \"PlantBot,\" which puts plants in control of their own mobility based on their need for sunlight. For midterm, guest critics provide feedback to students' presentations of their final project concepts. Final projects can be developed in conjunction with other ITP course work, such as networked objects, social media, game design, physical computing, thesis, mobile computing; or a written research analysis.

First technologies like TiVO and DVR allowed consumers to timeshift their viewing behavior. Then the Slingbox and services like BitTorrent allowed consumers to easily placeshift their viewing environments. Next, a wave of on-line services like YouTube, Joost, Hulu, Boxee, and Netflix introduced an unlimited supply of on-demand content ranging from short-form user generated content to weekly TV shows to long-form movies. As these technologies proliferated, the epicenter of the TV watching experience quickly shifted from in front of your HDTV in your living room to anywhere, everywhere, and anytime ? on your TV, PC, or mobile device. However, the continued disruption of television has only just begun as we now move into the era of Social TV. What had started as a two-screen experience (Facebooking on laptop   waching TV) has now become a one-screen experience. (see Barack Obama?s inauguration viewing on CNN.com). Additionally, services like FiOS TV and Yahoo! are introducing widget platforms that allow designers and developers to integrate Twitter and Facebook into the TV watching experience. As a result, designers and developers are able to explore a myriad of social TV possibilities. In this class, students are challenged to design the future of television as they follow a rigorous design methodology that teaches them how to go from idea to functional prototype. Students conduct user research, create user personas, create conceptual user journeys, and wireframe their concepts before beginning prototype work. Students work in small project teams of 2-3 and weekly classes cover design methodology and various topics relevant to the future of television such as next generation user interface design, social TV, and TV on mobile devices. Each week, students are expected to present their project updates with open class discussion in the form of critique sessions. The students are expected to prototype a final project so prior experience with web programming, and prototyping software (Adobe Flash) is helpful, but not required. The final project requires a functional prototype with supporting design documentation. Executives from the advertising, media, and consumer electronics industries are invited to class to provide guest critiques and to speak about future trends within television. \n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2784 \u00ab",

These new developments are often perceived simultaneously as creating distance and bridging distance. Because the invention of technologies of intimacy is a perennial pursuit at ITP, the goal of the class is to enrich students' ability to create meaningful and successful projects related to intimacy. Students gain a studied and nuanced understanding of the idea of intimacy and the physical and emotional experiences associated with it? as well as examining how existing and cutting-edge technologies work to connect intimates across the physical and metaphorical distances they routinely experience in everyday life. The first section of the course is devoted to studying intimacy, bonding, attachment, longing and desire from a variety of perspectives. These will include psychology and psychoanalysis? e.g.: Freud, Erich Fromm, Lacan, Kristeva, John Bowlby on attachment, Jessica Benjamin on bonding, Donald Winnicott on intersubjectivity; recent neuroscience, neurochemistry, and evolutionary biology related to intimacy and bonding; and recent psychological work specifically regarding intimacy and the internet. The second section of the course focuses on current art and technology projects? along with commercial ventures? that explore mediated intimacy across distances (the examples are legion). We scrutinize these projects to understand what they do right and what they do wrong. And we investigate the language and syntax of mediated intimacy, including attempts to incorporate each of (or combinations of) the human senses into devices of connectedness. In seeking to articulate what makes a meaningful mediated experience of intimacy, the course also looks at a group of edge cases? for example, personal performances in public (from web-cam girls to performance art)? that support asymmetrical intimacies. Through this process, we attempt to define a set of possible methods from which to create work.

This class is intended to supplement the many network-centric classes at ITP. It is broad survey, both of contemporary thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods used in creating them. Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent). Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not all, production work in the class requires programming and possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well. Possible topics include: * topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few workable ones there are, and how there's no topology so stupid it isn't in use some place. * addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why the phone network and the internet differ even though they use the same wires * protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs * scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push systems * a discussion of security and its effects Possible exercises include: * Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware versions * Client-server programming * A group protocol/messaging exercise * An HTTP/RESTian model exercise\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2808 \u00ab",

Small cheap digital cameras together with image processing, 3D modeling, cloud computing, and crowd-sourcing have enabled new ways to seamlessly aggregate images. The ultimate end result may be an unimaginably giant Earth model, containing as much detail as is chosen to add. The big players know it. Yahoo has Flickr (with over 2 billion images) and Flickr Maps, Microsoft has Live 3D and Photosynth, and Google has Google Earth and Streetview. Advances and new features spring up weekly, but so have critical concerns, for example, around access, control, privacy, and authenticity. The artist and activist communities know it as well and have responded in lively and provocative ways. This class attempts to make sense out of this fast-moving and uncharted domain. It is organized around six sections, two weeks each: (intro) ?A Thousand Zapruders?, 1) ?Billions and Billions of Photos? (the qualitative impact of colossal image libraries), 2) ?Just Like Being There? (photo-realism and the psychophysics of mediated perception), 3) ?Moving Through Space? (mediated navigation and how it compares to real-world navigation), 4) ?Merging and Morphing? (combining images to create new viewpoints), 5) ?Rich 3D Modeling? (making 3D computer models from photos), 6) ?Liveness? (the role of streaming real-time images, video, and data in Earth models), and (close) ?The One Earth Model?. For each section, we will examine fundamental concepts, track what?s out there, and debate concerns. Students are expected to produce a research presentation for each section, diving into specific areas of interest to them.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2810 \u00ab",

Discussion ranges from writing clean source code to Sol Lewitt, Douglas Engelbart and Edward Tufte. On the technical side the course examines how to parse data from XML (including Atom and RSS feeds), CSVs, and images. We cover simple chart, graph, and connectivity examples before moving on to your own visual experimentation. By semester's end you should be able to load data, render something visually compelling, and have something interesting to say about it. \n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2812 \u00ab",

We take a close look at the way people use their everyday objects in a fresh and innovative way and integrate gathered knowledge into physical products with new typologies in the context of human needs. The goal is to integrate the major aspects of classic product design process functional, structural and aesthetic with an emphasis on designing the experience of using the product as opposed to designing only the product itself.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2903 \u00ab",

Designed a toy that kids instantly ripped apart? Created an instrument that malfunctioned on stage? Simple proof-of-concept prototypes are a great way to explore new ideas but sometimes, more advanced prototyping and fabrication techniques are needed to achieve a polished end result. Knowing the appropriate tools and components for a given project can really make a difference in transforming an idea from your sketchbook into a solid piece of hardware. This class demonstrates how to design projects that are physically smaller, easily reproducible and more reliable. Topics will include understanding schematics, part sourcing, PCB design, surface mount components and soldering, modular systems, enclosure design and more. The course is designed to act as a kind of lab section in support of other physical computing based classes such as Wearables, NIME, Toy Design, Wildlife Tracking and others. Students are encouraged to have projects in mind to work on but there will be weekly/bi-weekly assignments to demonstrate skills learned in class. Class sessions will consist of lectures, hands-on demos and workshop time. Students are expected to have some basic programming skills.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2904 \u00ab",

A group of dedicated consumers? A social community with a cause? An embarrassment? Until the early 90's these questions were strictly the property of academic theorists. Then the internet arrived, and suddenly, whatever else fandom might be, it was also big business. As the stigma associated with fan cultures continues to decrease, thanks, in large part, to the rise of the tech sector, fandom's true economic clout is being felt for the first time in its long and varied history.\n\nThis is the new world of consumer-based fandom: Entertainment firms scramble to launch new superhero movies, clothing retailers are gradually embracing crowdsourcing, and insurance company spokespeople have millions of fans. The class will investigate the historical and sociological implications of fandom as it emerges from the shadows, starting from early music and religious movements through to current-day Maker communities. From what was once a subversive veneration of trash culture, we'll explore how the newly-lowered barrier to fandom is allowing fans to experiment with new identities, picking and choosing which ones will contribute to their own personal brand.\n\nWhat are the circumstances that cause identity-building in fans and the associated trappings of content creation? How can we as designers and technologists create in such as way as to invoke the delight and enchantment necessary for the conversion from mere consumer to rabid fan? We will examine how to inspire a productive fanbase by analyzing brands ranging from Apple to PBR to the Cheezburger networks and situations spanning from Professional Wrestling to Tom Petty...and every meme in between. Along the way, we'll confront what it means to be a fan, both as creators in search of an audience and as innovators in search of like-minded peers. \nFandom: it's not just for nerds anymore.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2965 \u00ab",

This course aims to provide the conceptual and technical foundation for using flying robots for visionary purposes. Here, technology is the tool. The air vehicle is the paintbrush, the poster, the camera; visible to some degree but not the purpose. The first step is to strip down the employment of a flying robot to its essence, as a means to gather information or take action at a distance, using an autonomous agent. The group will discuss and expand the current thinking on feasible, worthy objectives for flying robots, from art to science, from observation to communication, from performance to activism. Throughout the course, these conceptual topics will be a backdrop for hands-on projects using accessible technology. \n\nThe projects will investigate:\n\n\u2022 Performing a task with a flying robot\n\u2022 Moving information and decision-making\n\u2022 Making a craft fly autonomously\n\nThe projects will be performed in small teams and will require conceptualization, system design, and mechanical, electrical and coding work. The types of small aircraft could include quadcopters, blimps, planes, or less conventional platforms. Flight controls will be done using the Arduino-based ArduPlane and ArduCopter, or other embedded computing platforms. The online DIY/hobbyist community will be used as a resource.

Yet our brains are designed to direct our attention to a thin stream of operational tasks. We screen out the shoes of the person across the subway and the leaves on the trees above our heads. We don't pay much attention to the interplay of shadows or consciously hear the soft squeaking of distant doors. In conversations we rarely attend to what goes unsaid, though vital information often lurks in the omissions. The seeds of a brilliant work might lie in detecting a simple gesture. We only need to notice it. This class is a workshop that teaches techniques and tools for noticing\u2014seeing, hearing and comprehending what might otherwise pass us by. In a series of focused classes we explore the observation process in an abundant array of domains, from cognitive psychology to ethnography, drawing to data collection, user research to police work. Projects include sketching, user studies, experimental research, ideation, observational exercises and techniques for reaching that moment we all crave when something unexpected and terrific bursts forward into our consciousness. The class culminates in a final work inspired by one of your brand-new discoveries and honed with the help of the observational techniques and tools learned in class. Students should leave with their eyes and minds opened to the inspirations that surround us all.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2973 \u00ab",

Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. This change in the economics of communication has opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several profound effects in the media landscape today. This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere. This course covers the history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation from weblogs and wikis and Twitter to fan fiction and lolcats. The course centers on readings and field observation, with three papers due during the course of the term.\n\n      less description for ITPG-GT 2994 \u00ab",
