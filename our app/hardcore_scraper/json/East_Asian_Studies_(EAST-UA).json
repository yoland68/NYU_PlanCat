From 1990-present, a period of democratic transition in Korea, we will also examine the increased possibility of moving between cities like Los Angeles and Seoul not as separate spaces, but almost as a single community, in tandem with money, goods, and information. Examining various narratives (including literature and film) about experiences of displacement, and of living within or on the margins of dominant cultures in 20th century Japan and United States, we will pay attention to how identities (such as Zainichi, or Korean-American) were constituted by and against complex regimes of differentiation and homogenization along lines of race, class, gender, and sexuality.\n\n      less description for EAST-UA  735 \u00ab",

Melodrama, with spectacular displays of emotional excesses and performances that arouse passion, is one of the most popular and accessible genres in Chinese culture. From family drama to leftist cinema, Chinese melodramatic imaginations take many different forms. This course looks at the transformation and development of melodrama in the twentieth century. Often associated with the modern and modernity, melodrama is popular in places where traditional values and the dominant political system have been violently thrown into question. Whereas many literary works of Chinese modernists take the form of melodrama, we begin by looking at early twentieth century texts as a way of understanding a literary revolution (May Fourth) that enabled the overflow of emotion over reason, often in the form of family melodramas. As we continue to investigate the shifting forms of melodrama, we will look at melodramatic imaginations in 1930s Shanghai leftist cinema, post-1949 socialist realism and revolutionary drama, and post-Cultural Revolution literature and film. Studying texts that span a century, we will ask questions about melodrama\u2019s social and political ramifications. In additional to primary texts, course readings also include critical theory, gender, genre and comparative study.\n\n      less description for EAST-UA  952 \u00ab",
