How have artists understood the city itself as material, content, creative convergence? While we will look at artistic projects from various global urban contexts, New York City will serve as a primary ongoing site for reference, investigation and engagement. New York will be explored through the work of essayists and fiction writers who have taken the city as subject. We will also direct and make regular excursions into the surrounding urbanscape to shape our creative practices. Students will engage in weekly readings and discussions, complete writing assignments to hone conceptual skills, and create and evaluate their own original artworks both individually and in groups.\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2000 \u00ab",

We will think about the complexities that lie between the politics that make art and the politics that art makes?which is to say the array of forces that give rise to specific artistic practices and the agency and efficacy of artistic work. The course will be framed by the following considerations: What are the institutional, discursive, and ideological contexts that shape the objects, images, sounds or texts we call ?art?? What are the links between cultural spaces-- the museum, the movie-theater, the gallery, the music/dance hall, the bookstore, the fashion runway, the public street, television, cyber space-- and the larger realm of politics? And how do these relationships impact, implicitly or explicitly, the ways we create, curate, or study the arts? How do consumers play an active role in the reception of artistic products and practices?  What is the relation between formally promulgated cultural policy and the tacit knowledge that artists call upon to get their work into the world? What dimensions of the broader cultural terrain are made legible through artistic practice? What are the means through which art intervenes in the political arena? ?Art? will be studied as a site of contested representations and visions, embedded in power formations-- themselves shaped by specific historical moments and geographical locations. Given contemporary global technologies, cultural practices will also be studied within the transnational ?travel? of ideas and people. Such germane issues as the legal and constitutional dimensions of censorship, the social formation of taste, the consumption of stars, the bio-politics of the body, transnational copyrights law-- will all pass through an intersectional analyses of gender, race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and nation, incorporating the insights of such areas of inquiry as multiculturalism, feminism, postcolonialism, and queer studies. Each session is organized around the exploration of a key term, with readings that develop conceptual and practical issues. Art examples will be shown in class.\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2001 \u00ab",

The course will examine the praxis of collaboration and its content as process and outcome in an international frame of reference. How do we grow and sustain collaborative teamwork in the art context between countries? Students will be asked to create and acknowledge their collaborative agency producing performances, creative platforms, installations, archives, maps, etc  involving their peers, communities, international networks, other artivists or scientists. There is going to be an allocated pool of artists and artivists as correspondents in various countries in Europe to correlate with.  Why is working together with  - a different language, country, cultural framework-  the way in order to share and develop a vision? How is a shared interest presented in a multi-authored project? What can synergy offer to a dynamic dialogue within a framework of trust and sharing? When does collaboration create a synthesis of different perspectives? This course will challenge the notions of hierarchy through systematic roles of participatory interdependence and integrative exchange. The partnerships will evolve through fully documented stages which include: setting the project, its direction and the means of implementation. Communication is a key notion in valuing diversity and thus the focus will be equally - apart from the project itself \u2013on the interpersonal relationships built around it as well. The developmental process of collaboration will dissect the steps of framing the project, planning, setting goals, and coordinate openly in joint practices and collective consensus. The questions do what, for what, so what will be present so the peer\u2019s and instructor\u2019s feedback will illuminate actions and resources.\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2006 \u00ab",

With the help of the required texts we will examine socially accepted notions of the \"other\" and see how they are derived and or challenged in and by films, thus looking at how an art form can interact with socially accepted forms of \"othering.\" The objective of the course is to train emerging artists and scholars to engage in critical analysis that can make profound contributions to the individual's unique creative or analytical process.

Students will be actively involved in interviewing, organizing open forums, gathering the voices of the diverse cultural arts community in what could be a comprehensive New York City Cultural Plan?\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2025 \u00ab",

Students will be introduced to both recent and historically significant comics about war. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between image and text in sequential art, the fundamentals of graphic novel development, and the ability to critically analyze graphic novels that deal with challenging subject matter. What are the ethical and methodological issues that arise when constructing sequential narratives of war? Are there differences between war narratives that are autobiographical, documentary or fictional? Is there something unique about the format of graphic novels that enables artists to tell a different kind of war story than filmmakers, musicians or performers? How do comic books circulate culturally, and how might this expand or limit their ability to inform our understandings of war? We will explore these questions through close readings, robust discussions and careful written analysis of well-known works by Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi and Joe Sacco, as well as graphic novels by Keiji Nakazawa, Mira Kirshner, Jason Lutes, J.P Stassen, Gipi, Emmanuel Guibert and others.\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2046 \u00ab",

We will mainly examine the ways films/videos, novels, memoirs, and visual work have represented dislocations that have come in the wake of colonial partitions, and of regional, ethnic and religious conflicts; as well as into the ways they challenge traditional genres about immigration, transcending the neat divisions among the social documentary, the ethnographic media, the experimental autobiography, and the fictional narrative.

This course will examine both the national frameworks within which people create cultural expressions and the disaporic experience through which they maintain a relation between worlds. For example, what does it\nmean for a Chinese artist to live and work in France while maintaining their Chinese roots and sensibilities? We will examine intercultural perspectives and representations as they bear upon global and international for artistic work. We will also consider the meanings of global spectatorship in light of technological forms and mediations of particular cultural experiences. How do meanings change across these contexts and who decides or judges what is considered to be of greatest value? What role do international art markets play in how artists pursue their own creative process and professional opportunities? What kinds of art are considered suitable for international audiences, what are the political and cultural expectations for these forms? We will consider the ways in which such economic, cultural and esthetic questions figure in the shaping and articulation of cultural policy. How do the kinds of media and information that artists have access to shape the way in which they craft their own artistic responses and pursuits.\n\n      less description for ASPP-GT 2067 \u00ab",
