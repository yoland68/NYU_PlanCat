Through the exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth chemistry capstone proposal.  The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.",
