Postmodern perspectives such as relational theories,\nnarrative, culture and race, second wave feminist theories, queer theories,\nand social constructivism will be examined in relation to clinical practice\nwith vulnerable populations traditionally served by social workers.\nEmphasis will be placed on the critical review of each of these theories,\nparticularly in relation to each other and their clinical utility and\nlimitations when applied to at-risk populations.\nBest,\n\n      less description for DSWSW-GS 4002 \u00ab",
