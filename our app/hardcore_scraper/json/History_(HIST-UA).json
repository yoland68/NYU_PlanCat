It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 21st. Identical to AHSEM-UA 147.

In many ways, this course charts how Britain and its governments tried to find ways to simultaneously preserve economic strength and contain and ameliorate the ?social problem.? The various solutions to this raised questions about the role of the state, which still loom large in Britain and elsewhere. The course also examines several major cultural issues of the period?gender, science, religion, and race. Consequently, lectures are as likely to discuss evolutionary theory, prostitution, germs, and water mains as Queen Victoria, the Boer War, elections, and Charles Dickens.\n\n      less description for HIST-UA  162 \u00ab",

Spanning the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim western world, we will consider tales and legends of the supernatural and the ways that medieval people accepted and implemented otherworldly powers, in everyday life, and through a variety of practices: beliefs in fairies and miracles; the cults of holy men and women; astrology and fortune-telling; alchemy; folk medicine, including remedies and healing spells; death, burial customs, and vampires; allowing the devil fields of action, such as the imagination, sorcery, and witchcraft. Both learned and popular medieval cultures reserved a place for the practice of magical arts. There was, however, a differentiated sociology of magic, for rural folk, urbanites, aristocrats, women, and clerics, all engaged with their own brands of belief and participation, which were in turn variously accepted or rejected by official authorities. The history of medieval magic intersects that of repression and persecution.\n\n      less description for HIST-UA  262 \u00ab",

The United Nations estimates that by 2030 as many as 4 billion people will not have access to enough water for their basic needs. During the course of this semester we will read about both contemporary issues that affect us as well as look at the historical context in which these problems developed. We will focus on the United States, in particular the American West and New York City. We will use these case studies as a launching point for looking comparatively at issues that touch on problems in the Middle East, China, and Africa.\n\n      less description for HIST-UA  594 \u00ab",

These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories in the United States documenting the history of radical politics, civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions. Identical to AHSEM-UA 168. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.\n\n      less description for HIST-UA  664 \u00ab",
