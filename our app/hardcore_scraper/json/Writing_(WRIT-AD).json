In doing so, we will investigate the difference between of \u201cseeing\u201d and \u201cviewing\u201d as a method of analysis. Students will identify the principal themes that connect all forms of his artistic expression, including commitment to artistic endeavors and psychological imprisonment.\n \nStudents will be given the opportunity to express a conceptual claim from the artist with a visual medium. Together we will explore whether the intentions of the artist can be conveyed more plausibly with words or through sculpture. Our discussion will address whether art is an imitation of words or a source of knowledge that can stand alone without words. What can be communicated without words? Does Michelangelo\u2019s writing serve as an inspiration for his sculpture or do his sculptures further ignite his writing?\nDid the existence of an artist like Michelangelo keep a certain type of language or art alive and thus help others to see the world with new eyes?\n\n      less description for WRIT-AD   50J \u00ab",

The texts examined in this course are designed to underscore the provocative and creative ways an idea can be expressed and responded to. Artists are visionaries. They reconfigure what they see into countless forms and multi-dimensional shapes, and in the process they transform the way we see, and engage with the world. This Analysis and Expression course introduces students to various art forms, studying them in the context of time (history), culture (place) and aesthetics (philosophy and form). They are examined through the lens of four dialectical themes: Faith & Reason, the Individual & Society, Tragedy & Beauty, and Conflict & Resolution. Students become familiar with formal analysis and the basic language of the arts \u2013 film, photography, painting, music, sculpture and literature \u2013 to be able to write and discuss the work with more fluency. They develop skills in close-reading both visual and written texts, with weekly writing exercises designed to stimulate analytical thought. The writing exercises move them toward the completion of three scholarly papers through a drafting process: a well argued response to a single reading; an analytical dialogue between two or more texts, and a more deeply researched/argument based essay of their own choosing. Students give one oral/visual presentation on an assigned topic, and a shorter oral presentation outlining the ideas for their final paper.\nTextiles in Culture, Art & Science \nTextiles surround us, literally. Unlike other animals, humans are clothed, and therefore have a long history of using cloth for both functional and ritual purposes. Textiles carry culture and craft, are powerful political symbols and tools, and there are numerous examples of textile thinking in art, design, and the sciences. Analysis & Expression: Textiles in Culture, Art & Science takes up the exploration of textiles in order to teach writing as a process that leads to polished scholarly essays. All students who take A & E will complete the course with a deepened understanding of thinking through writing, shaping an essay, making arguments and using evidence, writing multiple drafts, proofreading and revision, conducting research, adopting a citation method, and achieving fluency in writing, including how to achieve error-free English grammar. Students will write three formal essays through a progression of exercises and give a final oral presentation on their research. We will explore and write about textiles with the following questions in mind: How is the study of textiles also the study of global flows: globalization in trade, labor, and economics? How do textiles challenge the division between \u201ccraft\u201d and \u201cfine art\u201d? What do textiles teach us about ecology, nature, and environmentalism? How are textiles used in scientific and mathematical thinking and modeling? What does the study of clothing tell us about culture, identity, politics?\nPattern Language \nAnalysis & Expression: Pattern Language explores the patterning of societies, drawing on anthropology, sociology, economics, and the arts. A \u201cpattern language\u201d is a term used by architect Christopher Alexander to argue that buildings that have been produced by an iterative process\u2014a process for arriving at a decision or a desired result by repeating rounds of analysis or cycles of operations\u2014are better to live in and look at then ones imposed by an outside intelligence. Humans use patterns to make sense of the world and also create patterns that have lasting effects. We will investigate how humans are shaped by their environment and in term shape them. We\u2019ll explore writing as a ritual and how rituals came to be written down. Finally, we\u2019ll identify common aspects of human experience that are shared across cultures and historical epochs.\nWriting In Disguise\nThis section of A&E looks at the problems and pleasures of \u201cwriting in disguise,\u201d and considers how diverse forms of literary deception relate to other social, cultural, artistic, and political uses of disguise, broadly defined.  In conversation with historical and contemporary investments in authenticity and objectivity, we will explore the stakes of persuasive writing across multiple genres. We will examine the questions raised when a writer, for example, \u201cdisguises\u201d one literary form within another (Jennifer Egan\u2019s Black Box), embellishes a true story with fictional details (Mike Daisey\u2019s The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs), or self-censors her work in anticipation of official censorship (Alexandra Kollontai\u2019s Autobiography).  Alongside texts like these, which require us to \u201cread between the lines,\u201d we will look at texts that investigate the many ways in which disguise infiltrates, orders, and disorders our daily lives. We will ask and attempt to answer some of the many questions these texts, taken together, raise: How is \u201cwriting in disguise\u201d like what we do everyday? How is it like what an actor does, or a politician? When a writer chooses a voice with which to speak, whether a voice she would call her own or a voice she borrows, how might this relate to the way we often present ourselves differently in different contexts? And then, how do examples of \u201cwriting in disguise\u201d mirror or differ from our own efforts when we write academic essays?\nYou will write often in class and expect to have lively discussions about written and visual texts.  You will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation about the material of Essay 3.  For the first two essays you will be given a progression of low-stakes writing exercises that lead to the drafting process.  These exercises are designed to push you to higher levels of critical thinking: they ensure a recursive process so that you are always reexamining your original take on the texts at hand.  You will use the material of these exercises in addition to in-class and tutorial work as you write your essays. For Essay 3 you are on your own to choose your favorite topic of the course and write a research essay that showcases all the skills you have practiced in the class.  This final essay will be assessed as a means of determining your facility with these skills and how prepared you are to take more writing-intensive courses.  \nA&E: Writing in Disguise, will give you innovative and sometimes controversial material; ask you to revel in the world of ideas and debate; give you practice speaking about your ideas in public; and most importantly help you build a solid foundation of writing and critical thinking skills that will serve you well in the university.\nImagi(nation)\nWe tend think of locales as something physical, something experienced. We know where we are (and where we are from) partly because we have physical experiences of those places: a grandmother\u2019s kitchen, a summer cottage, a smell of the ocean, the particular light on Scandinavian summer nights, or the sound of the jungle. Locale is typically the embodied geography of our lives and experiences.  However, what happens when geographies and their relation to identity\u2014national and/or personal\u2014are imagined in cultural products? In this seminar, we will read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts in order to investigate how space and national and/or personal identity get imagined by the reader and, not least, how the text opens a space for the reader to imagine a world personally unknown.  We will think of the seminar\u2019s foundational texts as being simultaneously in and out of time and space, thereby forcing us to also think about our own lived geographies.   \n\nWe set out by thinking about essays, short stories, and poems that all attempt to capture an experience of self in relation to a locale.  Writers will include Joan Diddion, Richard Blanco, Karen Blixen, Tony Kushner, and Jamaica Kincaid. For the second paper we turn our attention to how the popular genre of crime fiction\u2014from Agatha Christie to Henning Mankell\u2014functions in the construction of imagined geographies. For the third paper, students choose a cultural artifact (poems, plays, monuments, films, memoires, paintings, newspaper articles etc.) and make an argument about the imagining of nation.  Finally, students will produce an oral conference presentation of their research. Theoretical texts include Edward Said, Benedict Anderson, Anthony Kwame Appiah, Judith Butler and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.\n\n      less description for WRIT-AD  110 \u00ab",

With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues. \nA significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media.

Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon and Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle\u2019s, Hegel\u2019s, and George Steiner\u2019s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan\u2019s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier\u2019s Melancholia.\n\n      less description for WRIT-AD  130 \u00ab",
