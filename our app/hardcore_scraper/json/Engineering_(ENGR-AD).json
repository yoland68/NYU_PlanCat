The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester.
