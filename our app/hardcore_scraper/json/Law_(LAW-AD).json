Its subject matter is no longer limited to the \u201cforeign relations\u201d of nations.  International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another.  It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example.  But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory.  It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International.  Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties).  It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).\n\n      less description for LAW-AD  212J \u00ab",

In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The course will encourage students to identify the climate change policy issues in state and international laws. Students will also study how international law and international relations influence current national laws and policies. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun and Durban Agreements. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions. The class will also examine energy and climate change nexus and the roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration. The course will pay special attention to the role of developing countries in the emerging international climate change regime and negotiation strategies of G77+China in Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, and upcoming UNFCCC conference in Peru in December 2014.\n\n      less description for LAW-AD  213 \u00ab",
