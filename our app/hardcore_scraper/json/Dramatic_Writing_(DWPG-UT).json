This course will specifically address those needs \u2013 how to write a teaser or an act break, for example. It will address questions like how to write the final scene in an episode so that the episode comes to a conclusion while the dramatic momentum of the show continues. We\u2019ll target the specific nature of writing conflict scenes between two regular characters (the most important scenes in episodic television). But we\u2019ll also examine such issues as: writing scenes involving both regular and guest cast members; writing within the \u201cvoice\u201d of a show; and how to write a scene displaying incremental character development (the greatest differential between episodic TV, and all other forms of dramatic scene writing). This course is particularly well suited to summer because students will have a significant opportunity to rewrite and transform their scenes.\n\n      less description for DWPG-UT 1149 \u00ab",
