Through a highly interactive approach, students will gain a theoretical and hands-on understanding of the critical components of managing and leading in organizations.  \n\nOur focus will be on both government and nonprofit organizations and how managing in these organizations is different from managing in the for- profit sector.  For example, we will discuss public administration in the context of a democracy and the challenges of administrative leadership in an often  highly charged political system.  We?ll explore public personnel administration and Human Resource Development and discuss the government budgeting process.  We?ll also review the nature of public policy and the relationship between policy decisions and program implementation. We will also discuss the nature of managing in nonprofit organizations and the challenges of being primarily a service provider.  We?ll focus on the difficulties in evaluating and controlling service delivery, such as evaluating the impact of a mentoring program on a young man?s self-esteem.  We?ll also discuss the unique challenges in obtaining resources through foundations and other funding sources.\n\n      less description for UPADM-GP  103 \u00ab",

The first part of the class reviews  divergent perspectives for thinking about health and society. We begin by comparing clinical and public health perspectives on health and illness, reviewing alternative definitions of these concepts, tools for their assessment, and the contributions of social and economic theory, as well as health services research, to the study of health and society. For example, we will we examine key studies on health and health care among geographic areas and socio-economic groups in society. We will also consider how these perspectives were influenced by the evolution of public health, medicine and the health care system over the course of the past century.  The second part of the class draws on these perspectives to study the health care system in the United States, how it compares to that of other nations and how population aging, urbanization and globalization are raising new challenges for health and society, worldwide. We begin by studying alternative approaches to health care financing and organization and analyzing the U.S. health care system in this context. Next, we consider how increases in human longevity and population aging will affect the organization and financing of health and social services. Also, we consider two emerging areas of study related to health and society: \"urban health\" and \"global health.\" Finally, we consider issues of health care reform in the United States in light of the experience of other wealthy nations abroad, which have developed systems of universal health care coverage.\n\n      less description for UPADM-GP  230 \u00ab",

The role of the legal system with respect to adverse medical outcomes, economic rights, and individual rights is also discussed.

Yet genocide remains a tragic part of the human experience.  Its persistence raises urgent questions: Is genocide preventable?  Is it an inescapable aspect of human nature, or the weapon of the grossly-deviant vicious?  Can policymakers detect early signs of genocide and prevent it from occurring?  Or is punishment after the act of genocide the only viable instrument of international policy?  This course will explore these and other questions by examining genocide in an historic and legal context.  Proposed policy solutions will be evaluated through a focus on such case studies as Armenia, Ukraine, Cambodia, and the ongoing genocide in Darfur.\n\n      less description for UPADM-GP  240 \u00ab",

This area has become one of the fastest growing segments for business and academic development, and this course is a component of the Minor in Social Entrepreneurship for NYU undergraduates. Both business applications and social entrepreneurship areas will be explored in research, theory and practice during this class, through relevant readings, case studies, discussion and presentations by global social entrepreneurs. There will also be an experiential component to the class: students will both learn skills for cultural competency and global social entrepreneurship, and engage in a week long field experience in cultural immersion in a country outside of the United States. The field experience will focus on the various issues, possibilities and results, and the people involved with social entrepreneurial ventures in that country. To accomplish this goal, students will attend 15 hours of class at NYU during the spring semester and 35 hours of class in Shanghai, China the last week in May, 2012. The Shanghai segment includes 3 hours each morning in the classroom and at least 4 hours each afternoon in a cultural immersion practicum experience in the field. Altogether in Shanghai and NYC, the students will have at least 50 hours of class time and supervised practical experience for this 4 credit course. The New York-based classes are combined into longer meetings on two weekends rather than the more typical weekly sessions across the semester. Each class will include a segment on skill building and practice. The primary text here is CORE 4, with a focus on skills related to global experience. Global social entrepreneur skills center on cultural competency, emphasizing four specific themes: connection, liner (setting boundaries), convertor and strategist. These skill sets will enable students to be more effective global citizens and contributors for positive change in the world.\n\n      less description for UPADM-GP  270 \u00ab",
