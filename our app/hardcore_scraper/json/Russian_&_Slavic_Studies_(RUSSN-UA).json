We will study the intellectual products of Russian interactions with the West \u2013 constitutional projects, scientific and economic thought, the Westernizer-Slavophile controversy, and revolutions. Substantial emphasis will be placed on the role of reading and translation in the making of cultural models: Russian Byronism, Russian Hamletism. More than ideas, the West came embodied in real people. We will consider the presence of European communities in Russia: German and British migrants who filled important niches in state service, trade, and scholarship; Italian sculptors and architects who designed some of Russia\u2019s most famous and symbolically potent monuments; Parisian aristocratic expatriates in the wake of the French Revolution; Communist workers and intellectuals, refugees from Nazi Germany; and foreign journalists who, in the late Soviet decades, trafficked illicit ideas, texts, and artworks.
