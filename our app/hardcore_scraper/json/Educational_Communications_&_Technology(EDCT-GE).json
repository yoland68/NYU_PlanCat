We explore how educational technologies are often designed from particular theoretical approaches that are linked to the work of leading educational research communities. We not only study the often hidden connection between the research community members & the technologies they affect, but also how these theories play upon each other in the invention of new paradigms for learning with technologies. In short, we delve deeply into constructivism/constructionism, scaffolding, apprenticeship, distributed cognition, computer-supported collaborative learning, knowledge-building communities, the learning sciences, perspectivity, & identity formation as they relate to the creation of successful & equitable learning environments for diverse populations of learners. Students write a final paper & conduct an evaluation of the embedded theories in an existing learning environment of their choice (such as Second Life, Logo, Scratch, NetLogo, The Sims).\n\n      less description for EDCT-GE 2175 \u00ab",

While the course will begin with a focus on constructivism & inquiry, students will experience the limitations of these learning theories as related to people's emotional & affective responses to instruction so designed. They will subsequently explore two much more \"playful\" learning modalities to help someone learn science: guided play & design-based science. Students will work in small teams to design & test instruction consistent with both approaches, aiming to teach the same middle school science content in both, so that they can compare & contrast their experiences. Three of the fourteen classes will be held on Saturdays to give students the opportunity to test their instructional designs-in-progress at the New York Hall of Science.\n\n      less description for EDCT-GE 2551 \u00ab",
