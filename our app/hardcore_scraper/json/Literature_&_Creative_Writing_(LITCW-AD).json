Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid. Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following\u2014and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin (The Scholar\u2019s Guide), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish (The Book of Dede Korkut), Hebrew (Tahkemoni), Arabic (Kalila and Dimna, 1001 Nights), and Urdu (Amir Hamza).

Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.\n\n      less description for LITCW-AD  134 \u00ab",
