The pre-labs that are given as lectures before the actual lab begins span a weekly 30-45 min and explain the principles behind the techniques that the students will apply that lab. Students are required to study the lab procedure in advance and be prepared for a quiz and discussion of the material.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nThis course aims at teaching students how to think like a true researcher as well as apply the key molecular biology techniques.\nDuring this course, students will be expected to: gain an understanding of the basics of molecular biology techniques and be able to apply these techniques in the lab;\nacquire the habits of a good scientist including accuracy, cleanliness, orderliness, safety, honesty, teamwork, curiosity, good time management, and self-reliance\ndevelop the ability to convey scientific information; this includes keeping good records with in a lab notebook, writing a satisfactory report, and oral communication;\ndraw conclusions from observed facts and support these conclusions with peer-reviewed literature.\n\n      less description for BIOL-SHU  123 \u00ab",
